/**
 * A pluggable engine that builds (or completes) a deck from a card pool. The heuristic engine
 * ([HeuristicDeckBuildAdvisor]) ships today; LLM- ([com.wingedsheep.ai.llm.AiDeckBuilder]) and
 * MCTS-backed engines can be added later by implementing this interface and registering them in
 * [AdvisorCatalog].
 *
 * Operates on resolved [CardDefinition]s (the server resolves pool card names against the registry),
 * because building needs the full card — colors, types, mana cost, and the effect tree the heuristic
 * rater walks.
