# Card SDK Language Reference

A complete catalog of every building block available to card authors in the Argentum
Engine `mtg-sdk`, with a one-line description for each. Designed to be scanned and
searched. For step-by-step authoring workflow see [`api-guide.md`](api-guide.md) (and use the
`add-card` skill); for hard cases see
[`managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md`](managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md).

**Maintenance rule:** this document is the canonical SDK catalog. **Every change to the
SDK — new effect, trigger, condition, filter, cost, keyword, dynamic amount, modal
shape, replacement effect, etc. — must update the matching section here in the same
change.** If the entry doesn't fit cleanly in an existing section, add or rename a
section; do not let SDK additions land without a corresponding doc update.

## 1. Top-level card DSL

**Entry points**

- `card("Name") { ... }` — open the builder for a standard card.
- `basicLand("Plains" | "Island" | "Swamp" | "Mountain" | "Forest")` — shortcut for basic lands (sets type line,
  intrinsic mana ability, supertype). Supports `collectorNumber`, `artist`, `flavorText`, `imageUri`, `rarity`, and
  `inBooster` (set `false` to keep an art variant defined but exclude it from the draft/sealed deck-building basic pool).

**Card builder properties**

- `manaCost: String` — mana cost in `{X}{R}{U}` syntax. Supported pip forms: generic (`{2}`),
  colored (`{R}`), colorless (`{C}`), variable (`{X}`), hybrid (`{W/U}` — either colour),
  Phyrexian (`{W/P}` — colour or 2 life), and monocolored hybrid / "twobrid" (`{2/B}` — two
  generic **or** one mana of the colour; mana value counts the generic side per CR 202.3f).
  Gurmag Nightwatch's `{2/B}{2/G}{2/U}` is the canonical twobrid example.
- `typeLine: String` — full type line including supertypes and subtypes. A `Legendary Instant` /
  `Legendary Sorcery` automatically gets the CR 205.4e casting restriction (can be cast only while
  its controller controls a legendary creature or legendary planeswalker) — the engine enforces this
  from the type line in both legal-action enumeration and the cast handler; no per-card opt-in needed.
- `oracleText: String` — rules text; auto-generated from abilities if omitted.
- `power: Int?`, `toughness: Int?` — base P/T for creatures.
- `dynamicPower`, `dynamicToughness` — characteristic-defining P/T (e.g. `*/*` Tarmogoyf).
- `dynamicStats(source, powerOffset?, toughnessOffset?)` — sets both with optional `±` deltas.
- `startingLoyalty: Int?` — starting loyalty for planeswalkers.
- `colorIdentity: String?` — override (normally auto-detected). Treated as authoritative in this repo.
- `auraTarget: TargetRequirement?` — what this Aura enchants.
- `morph: String?` — morph mana cost (cast face-down).
- `morphCost: PayCost?` — non-mana morph cost.
- `morphFaceUpEffect: Effect?` — effect that fires when this morph turns face up.
- `warp: String?` — Warp alt-cost; exiles at end of turn.
- `evoke: String?` — Evoke alt-cost; sacrifices on ETB.
- `selfAlternativeCost: SelfAlternativeCost?` — generic alternative-cost slot.
- `castTimeCreatureTypeChoice: CastTimeCreatureTypeSource?` — forces a creature-type choice at cast time.
- `cantBeCountered: Boolean` — spell is uncounterable.
- `cantBeCopied: Boolean` — spell can't be copied (CR 707.10); copy effects that name it create no copy (Display of Power).
- `conditionalFlash: Condition?` — gains flash while condition holds.
- `layout: CardLayout` — physical layout shape (see §2).

**Ability blocks inside `card { ... }`**

- `triggeredAbility { ... }` — "when/whenever/at" abilities.
- `staticAbility { ... }` — continuous effects.
- `activatedAbility { ... }` — `cost: effect` abilities.
- `loyaltyAbility(±N) { ... }` — planeswalker loyalty abilities.
- `replacementEffect { ... }` — "instead/if … would" replacement.
- `keywords(...)` / `keywordAbility(...)` / `keywordAbilities(...)` — add keyword abilities.
- `spell { ... }` — define the spell payload for instants/sorceries and Adventure / Omen faces.
- `leyline()` — Leyline mechanic ("If this card is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the
  battlefield"). Sets `CardScript.mayStartOnBattlefield = true`. After all mulligans and bottoming resolve, the
  engine walks each player in turn order from the active player and presents a yes/no decision per leyline card
  in their opening hand; a "yes" routes the card to the battlefield through the standard zone-change pipeline
  before the first turn begins, a "no" leaves it in hand.

## 2. Card faces, layouts, printings, set metadata

**`CardLayout`**

- `NORMAL` — standard single face (default).
- `SPLIT` — two or more halves on one card; combined characteristics apply off-battlefield (CR 709.4c). Used for Rooms,
  Fuse, Aftermath, and the classic Invasion split cards (Pain // Suffering, Stand // Deliver, Wax // Wane). Each half is
  cast independently via `CastSpell.faceIndex`; only the chosen half goes on the stack (CR 709.4). A non-permanent half
  carries its effect in a `face("Name") { spell { … } }` block (with its own `target(...)` requirements); a permanent
  half (Room) carries triggered/activated/static abilities instead.
- `ADVENTURE` — primary face is a creature, `cardFaces[0]` is an instant/sorcery Adventure (CR 715). Resolving the
  Adventure exiles the card and grants permission to cast the creature from exile.
- `OMEN` — primary face is a permanent (creature), `cardFaces[0]` is an instant/sorcery Omen (Tarkir: Dragonstorm).
  Casts exactly like an Adventure (creature face, or Omen via `CastSpell.faceIndex = 0`), but resolving the Omen
  **shuffles the card into its owner's library** instead of exiling it — no cast-from-exile linkage. DSL:
  `card { omen("Name") { spell { … } } }`.
- `MODAL_DFC` — primary characteristics are the front face, `cardFaces[0]` is the back face (CR 712). Cast **one**
  face from hand (front via primary characteristics, back via `CastSpell.faceIndex = 0`), never both. Unlike
  ADVENTURE there is no exile-then-recast linkage — a spell back resolves as an ordinary spell (graveyard, or exile
  when its script sets `selfExileOnResolve` via `spell { selfExile() }`). DSL: `card { modalBack("Name") { spell { … } } }`.
- `PREPARE` — primary characteristics are the creature face, `cardFaces[0]` is the **prepare spell** (an
  instant/sorcery) (Secrets of Strixhaven). The card is only ever cast as the creature; the prepare spell is never
  cast from hand. A creature that carries `Keyword.PREPARED` ("This creature enters prepared") becomes prepared on
  enter; one without the keyword (e.g. Leech Collector) only becomes prepared via an effect — `Effects.BecomePrepared(target)`.
  When it becomes prepared, the engine creates a **copy of the prepare spell in exile** that the controller may cast for
  the face's cost — surfaced by the cast-from-exile enumerator as `CastSpell(..., faceIndex = 0)` from `EXILE`.
  Casting the copy unprepares the creature; the copy ceases to exist on resolution. The exile copy persists in
  exile (exempt from the 707.10a phantom-copy SBA) until the source leaves the battlefield or stops being prepared,
  at which point it is cleaned up. A creature already prepared does not re-prepare. DSL: `card { prepare("Name") { spell { … } } }`.

**`CardFace` (SPLIT / ADVENTURE / OMEN / MODAL_DFC / PREPARE)**

- `name` — face name.
- `manaCost` — face mana cost.
- `typeLine` — face type line.
- `script { ... }` — that face's abilities; for instant/sorcery SPLIT halves, Adventures, and modal DFC spell
  faces this includes a `spell { effect = …; target(...) }` block holding the face's effect and target
  requirements (plus `selfExile()` for faces that exile themselves on resolution).
- `keywords` — face-local keywords.
- `imageUri` — face art when it differs from the front (MODAL_DFC backs have their own Scryfall image).

**`metadata { ... }`**

- `rarity: Rarity` — `COMMON | UNCOMMON | RARE | MYTHIC | SPECIAL | BONUS`.
- `collectorNumber: String` — Scryfall collector number.
- `artist: String` — illustrator credit.
- `flavorText: String` — italicized flavor.
- `imageUri: String?` — art URL; auto-fetched from Scryfall if omitted.
- `scryfallId: String?` — Scryfall UUID.
- `releaseDate: String?` — `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `inBooster: Boolean` — part of the draft/sealed product (default `true`; `false` for Special Guests / starter
  exclusives). Gates both the booster pool and the basic-land variants offered during limited deck building.
- `oracleTextOverride: String?` — bypass auto-generated oracle text.

**Reprints** — add a `Printing` row in the new set's `Reprints.kt` and wire it into `MtgSet.printings`. Never duplicate
the `CardDefinition`.

**`Printing`** — a presentation-only row for one printing of a card (oracle identity stays on the `CardDefinition`).
Carries `setCode`, `collectorNumber`, `scryfallId`, `artist`, `imageUri`, `backFaceImageUri`, `releaseDate`, `rarity`,
plus the frame fields:

- `isFullArt: Boolean` — Scryfall full-art treatment.
- `frameEffects: List<String>` — Scryfall `frame_effects` (e.g. `["showcase"]`, `["inverted"]`).
- `borderColor: String?` — Scryfall `border_color` (`"black" | "white" | "borderless"`).
- `isAlternateFrame: Boolean` (derived) — true when the printing is a **showcase** frame
  (`"showcase" in frameEffects`) or **borderless** (`borderColor == "borderless"`). This is the predicate the booster
  variant slot selects on; plain full-art / promo treatments are not counted.

`CardDefinition.withPrinting(printing)` returns a copy presenting that printing — it overlays only presentation
metadata (set code, collector number, art, artist, Scryfall id, and the back-face art for genuine DFCs) and leaves the
card's oracle identity untouched.

**Showcase / borderless in boosters** — a set advertises a per-card variant rate via `MtgSet.boosterVariantChance`
(default `0.0`). When non-zero, `BoosterGenerator` rolls each generated card independently and, on a hit, re-skins it
with one of its `isAlternateFrame` `printings` of the same name (via `applyVariantPrintings` →
`CardDefinition.withPrinting`). The swap is presentation-only: it changes the art shown in the draft/sealed pool, not
the card's rules or its in-game (name-resolved) art. Lorwyn Eclipsed sets `boosterVariantChance = 0.15` and contributes
its showcase/borderless rows via `LorwynEclipsedVariantPrintings` — the play-booster treatments only, with the
collector-only ones (reversible shocklands, Japanese Showcase, Fracture Foil, serialized/headliner chase cards)
excluded.

## 3. Costs (`Costs.*`)

> **One cost vocabulary (`CostAtom`).** The payable things shared across cost *contexts* — mana, life,
> sacrifice, discard, exile-from-zone, tap, return-to-hand, reveal — are defined **once** in the
> `CostAtom` sealed hierarchy (`scripting/costs/CostAtom.kt`). All three context wrappers carry them via
> an `Atom(atom)` member: `PayCost.Atom`, `AdditionalCost.Atom`, and `AbilityCost.Atom` each hold one
> `CostAtom`, leaving only their genuinely context-specific members on the wrapper
> (`PayCost.OwnManaCost` / `PayCost.Choice`; `AdditionalCost`'s Behold / Blight / Forage / ChooseEntity
> / per-target life / variable exile; `AbilityCost`'s `Free`, `Tap`/`Untap`, the X-variable costs
> (`PayXLife`, `ExileXFromGraveyard`, `TapXPermanents`), the self-referential `SacrificeSelf` /
> `ExileSelf` / `ExileGrantingPermanent`, counter-removal, `Loyalty`, `Composite`, and named mechanics
> `Forage` / `Blight` / `Craft`). The `Costs.*` facades below are unchanged — they construct the right
> `…Atom(CostAtom.X(…))` for you, so card authoring is identical. A *new* payable thing is one
> `CostAtom` variant + one engine payment branch, available in every context.

- `Costs.Free` — costs nothing (`{0}`).
- `Costs.Tap` — `{T}`; tap this permanent.
- `Costs.Untap` — `{Q}`; untap this permanent.
- `Costs.Mana("{2}{U}")` — pay the given mana cost (string or `ManaCost`).
- `Costs.PayLife(amount)` — pay N life.
- `Costs.PayXLife` — pay X life, where X is the value chosen for the ability's `{X}` mana cost
  (e.g. "{X}{B}, {T}, Pay X life: …" on Krumar Initiate). The X-linked counterpart to
  `Costs.PayLife`; `calculateMaxAffordableX` caps X at the controller's life total — X may go as
  high as their current life, paying down to exactly 0 (legal per CR 119.4; they then lose to a
  state-based action).
- `Costs.Sacrifice(filter)` — sacrifice a permanent matching the filter (may include self).
- `Costs.SacrificeAnother(filter)` — sacrifice a *different* permanent matching the filter.
- `Costs.SacrificeMultiple(count, filter = Any, distinctNames = false)` — sacrifice `count` matching permanents. With `distinctNames = true` the chosen permanents must all have **different names** ("sacrifice three artifact tokens with different names" — Transmutation Font); the cost is only payable when ≥ `count` distinctly-named candidates exist, and the activation always pauses for the selection (it's a real choice even when candidates == count).
- `Costs.DiscardCard` — discard a card you choose (any card).
- `Costs.Discard(filter, count = 1, atRandom = false)` — discard `count` cards matching the filter.
  When `atRandom` is true the engine picks the cards (no player selection); otherwise the player
  chooses which cards to discard.
- `Costs.DiscardAtRandom(count, filter)` — discard `count` cards chosen at random (Meteor Storm:
  "Discard two cards at random").
- `Costs.DiscardHand` — discard your entire hand.
- `Costs.DiscardSelf` — discard this card (cycling-style).
- `Costs.DiscardLastDrawnThisTurn` — discard the specific card you drew most recently this turn
  (Jandor's Ring: "{2}, {T}, Discard the last card you drew this turn: Draw a card."). The engine
  tracks the per-player most-recently-drawn entity on `GameState.lastCardDrawnThisTurnByPlayer`
  (updated at every `CardsDrawnEvent` emit site during a turn; the last id of a multi-card draw
  wins; cleared at every turn boundary) and discards it automatically — no player selection. The
  cost is unpayable when the controller has not drawn a card this turn or the tracked card has
  since left their hand (matches the Scryfall ruling: "If you do not have the card still in your
  hand, you can't pay the cost").
- `Costs.ExileSelf` — exile this permanent (or graveyard card, for graveyard-activated abilities).
- `Costs.ExileFromGraveyard(count, filter)` — exile N matching cards from your graveyard.
- `Costs.ExileXFromGraveyard(filter)` — exile X cards from your graveyard (X = the ability's
  chosen X value).
- `Costs.Craft(filter, minCount = 1)` — Craft material cost (CR 702.167a): exile this permanent
  **and** exile at least `minCount` cards matching `filter` selected from the combined pool of
  permanents you control and cards in your graveyard. Atomic because CR 702.167a pairs the
  self-exile with the materials-exile in one clause. Records the chosen materials on the source's
  `CraftedFromExiledComponent` so the back face's CDA can read them after the source returns
  transformed. Always combined with `Mana(...)` and used with the
  `Effects.ReturnSelfFromExileTransformed` resolution effect (the `card { craft(filter, cost) }`
  helper wires the whole pattern).
- `Costs.Composite(c1, c2, ...)` — multiple costs paid together.

**Spell-level alternatives**

- `selfAlternativeCost` — generic "cast instead for" alt-cost.
- `evoke` — pay evoke cost; creature is sacrificed at ETB.
- `morph` — cast face-down for `{3}`-ish.
- `warp` — cast from anywhere; exiled at end of turn.
- `conditionalFlash` — flash while condition holds.
- `cantBeCountered` — spell is uncounterable.
- `cantBeCopied` — spell can't be copied (CR 707.10).
- `xManaRestriction = setOf(Color.BLACK, Color.RED)` — "spend only [colors] on X." Restricts which
  mana may pay the `{X}` portion of the cost (the fixed colored/generic portion is unaffected).
  Available in both `spell { }` and `activatedAbility { }` blocks; honored by the mana solver and the
  payment path. Per-color amount spent on X is then readable via `DynamicAmount.ManaSpentOnX(color)`.
  Soul Burn (`spell { xManaRestriction = setOf(Color.BLACK, Color.RED) }`) and Atalya, Samite Master
  (`activatedAbility { xManaRestriction = setOf(Color.WHITE) }`) are the first users.

**`Costs.additional.*`** (wraps `AdditionalCost`) — extra costs paid alongside the mana cost. Card
definitions construct these through the facade, e.g. `Costs.additional.SacrificePermanent(Filters.Creature)`.

- `Costs.additional.ReturnToHand(filter = Filters.Any, count = 1)` — "as an additional cost to cast
  this spell, return [count] permanent(s) you control to its owner's hand" (Fear of Isolation). Paid
  as the spell is cast (CR 601.2f) via `additionalCostPayment.bouncedPermanents`; the enumerator
  surfaces the returnable permanents (a `costType = "ReturnToHand"` cost) and the client picks them
  on the battlefield. The bounce goes through `ZoneTransitionService.moveToZone(…, Zone.HAND)`, so
  attached Auras fall off and tokens cease to exist. Mirrors the sacrifice/tap additional-cost path.
- `Costs.additional.BlightVariable` — "as you cast, you may pay X life" (Blight X); X exposed via
  `DynamicAmount.AdditionalCostBlightAmount`.
- `Costs.additional.PayXLife(minCount = 0)` — "as an additional cost to cast this spell, pay X life."
  The caster declares X at cast time (capped at their current life total) and X is fed to the spell's
  effects through the resolution **X value** — i.e. read it with `DynamicAmount.XValue` and filter with
  `CardPredicate.ManaValueAtMostX` / `manaValueAtMostX()` (Vicious Rivalry: "pay X life; destroy all
  artifacts and creatures with mana value X or less"). A card using this cost must **not** also have an
  `{X}` in its mana cost — both write the same X slot. The client shows a numeric X picker (no target
  step); the AI declares X = 0 by default.
- `Costs.additional.PayLifePerTarget(amountPerTarget)` — "this spell costs N life more to cast for
  each target." Pair with an unbounded `TargetCreature(unlimited = true)` etc.; the engine
  auto-pays `amountPerTarget × action.targets.size` at cast resolution (Phyrexian Purge).
- `Costs.additional.ExileFromGraveyardOrPay(exileCount, alternativeManaCost, filter = Filters.Any)`
  — "as an additional cost to cast this spell, exile N cards from your graveyard or pay {mana}"
  (Soaring Stoneglider: "exile two cards from your graveyard or pay {1}{W}"). The sibling of the
  `BlightOrPay` / `BeholdOrPay` "do X or pay mana" shapes. The enumerator offers up to two cast
  paths: the **exile path** (base cost + a graveyard-card selection of exactly `exileCount` cards
  matching `filter`, surfaced as a `costType = "ExileFromGraveyard"` cost — the same client picker
  used by a mandatory graveyard-exile cost) and the **pay path** (base cost + `alternativeManaCost`
  folded in). The chosen path is recovered at payment time from whether the cast action's
  `additionalCostPayment.exiledCards` is non-empty; the exile path is only offered when the
  graveyard holds at least `exileCount` matching cards.

**`Costs.pay.*`** (wraps `PayCost`) — payable costs used by [`PayOrSufferEffect`](#15-replacement-effects) ("do X
unless you Y") and by `morphCost` (non-mana face-up cost). Distinct from `AbilityCost` / `Costs.*`
which model an ability's activation cost; `PayCost` models a single cost the engine prompts the
player to pay against an alternative consequence.

Non-mana `morphCost` payment is routed through the shared engine `CostPaymentService`, so **every
`Costs.pay` variant below works as a morph cost** (including `Tap` / `Choice` / `OwnManaCost`): turning
the creature face up pauses for the cost-specific decision and only flips once the cost is paid.
(Mana morph costs keep their own up-front payment — explicit mana-source selection, X, auto-tap
preview — in the turn-face-up handler.)

- `Costs.pay.Mana(ManaCost)` — pay mana (auto-taps lands via the solver). "...unless you pay {U}{U}"
  (Vaporous Djinn).
- `Costs.pay.OwnManaCost` — pay the mana cost of the permanent the cost applies to (its *own* mana
  cost, read from `CardComponent.manaCost` at payment time). Use for granted abilities like
  Essence Leak ("...sacrifice this permanent unless you pay its mana cost"), where the affected
  permanent — not a fixed cost — owns the mana cost. The engine resolves it into a concrete
  `Costs.pay.Mana` against that permanent before prompting.
- `Costs.pay.PayLife(amount)` — pay N life; offered only when the player's life total is at least N
  (CR 119.4). "...unless you pay 3 life."
- `Costs.pay.Discard(filter = Any, count = 1, random = false)` — discard cards matching `filter`.
  Random variant prompts a yes/no and the engine picks the discards (Pillaging Horde).
- `Costs.pay.Sacrifice(filter = Any, count = 1)` — sacrifice permanents you control matching
  `filter`. Source is auto-excluded. "...unless you sacrifice three Forests" (Primeval Force).
- `Costs.pay.Exile(filter = Any, zone = HAND, count = 1)` — exile cards from `zone` matching
  `filter`. "...unless you exile a blue card from your hand."
- `Costs.pay.Tap(filter = Any, count = 1)` — tap untapped permanents you control matching `filter`.
  Source is auto-excluded. Tapping each emits a `TappedEvent` so "becomes tapped" triggers fire.
  "...unless you tap an untapped permanent you control" (Command Bridge).
- `Costs.pay.Choice(options)` — present several `PayCost`s; player picks one (or the suffer effect).
  Unaffordable options are hidden. "...unless they sacrifice a nonland permanent or discard a card."
- `Costs.pay.ReturnToHand(filter, count = 1)` — return permanents you control to their owner's hand.
  Currently only consumed by `morphCost`; not yet wired into `PayOrSufferEffect`.
- `Costs.pay.RevealCard(filter, count = 1)` — reveal a card from hand matching `filter`. Currently
  only consumed by `morphCost`; not yet wired into `PayOrSufferEffect`.

## 4. Effects (`Effects.*`)

Atomic effect factories. For library/zone manipulation, prefer the pipelines in §5.

### Damage

- `DealDamage(amount, target)` — deal fixed/dynamic damage.
- `DealDamageExcessToController(amount, target)` — deal damage to a creature; any amount beyond
  lethal (CR 120.4a) is dealt to that creature's controller instead (the creature is marked only with
  the lethal portion). Backed by `DealDamageEffect.excessToController`. Used by Gandalf's Sanction.
- `DealXDamage(target)` — deal X damage (spell's X).
- `AmplifyNoncombatDamageThisTurn(bonus)` — install an until-end-of-turn replacement (CR 616): every
  source you control deals `bonus` *additional* noncombat damage to any permanent or player this turn.
  Combat damage is unaffected; no opponent restriction. `bonus` (a `DynamicAmount`) is resolved once at
  resolution and baked in (typically `DynamicAmount.XValue` from an `{X}` cost); multiple installs stack
  additively. Read at damage time by the engine's static-amplification path, then cleaned up at end of
  turn. Distinct from the opponent-only, permanent-tied `NoncombatDamageBonus` static. Taii Wakeen,
  Perfect Shot: `{X}, {T}: … it deals that much damage plus X instead.`
- `Fight(target1, target2)` — two creatures each deal damage equal to their power to each other (CR 701.12).
- `DividedDamageEffect(totalDamage, minTargets, maxTargets, dynamicTotal?)` — "N damage divided as you
  choose among target ..." The targets come from the ability's target requirement; pair with
  `TargetCreature(count, minCount)` (Forked Lightning, Skirk Volcanist) or, for "any number of target"
  + a dynamic total, a `TargetObject(optional = true, dynamicMaxCount = ..., filter = ...)`. Set
  `dynamicTotal` (a `DynamicAmount`) for totals computed when the ability resolves/goes on the stack —
  Ureni, the Song Unending: `dynamicTotal = DynamicAmounts.landsYouControl()`. Works for creatures and
  planeswalkers (`GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrPlaneswalker`); zero chosen targets ⇒ no-op.
- `DamageCantBePreventedThisTurn()` — "Damage can't be prevented this turn." Turn-scoped one-shot that
  sets a `GameState` flag (cleared at the next turn boundary), shutting off all damage prevention for
  the rest of the turn — prevention shields, prevention/replacement-of-damage effects, and protection's
  prevention clause are ignored (CR 615.6). The static, permanent-hosted equivalent is the
  `DamageCantBePrevented` replacement effect (Sunspine Lynx); use this effect when a spell/ability needs
  the shutoff without a permanent on the battlefield (Fear, Fire, Foes!).

### Life

- `GainLife(amount, target?)` — target gains life (default: controller).
- `LoseLife(amount, target)` — target loses life.
- `SetLifeTotal(amount, target)` — set target's life total to N.
- `ExchangeLifeAndPower(target)` — swap target's power with controller's life total.
- `LoseHalfLife(roundUp, target, lifePlayer?)` — lose half of life total (round up/down).
- `LoseGame(target, message?)` — target loses the game.
- `RemoveMaximumHandSize(target?)` — "target has no maximum hand size for the rest of the game"
  (default target: controller). One-shot resolution effect that confers a permanent, player-scoped
  property via `PlayerNoMaximumHandSizeComponent` — unlike the battlefield-only `NoMaximumHandSize`
  *static ability* (§9, Reliquary Tower / Thought Vessel), it survives the source leaving any zone
  (e.g. Wisdom of Ages exiles itself on resolution). Idempotent. `CleanupPhaseManager` checks both
  this component and the static ability when discarding to hand size.
- `WinGame(target, message?)` — target wins the game.
- `TakeExtraTurn(target, loseAtEndStep?)` — target takes an extra turn after this one (Time Walk, Lost Isle Calling).
  Set `loseAtEndStep = true` for "...you lose the game at the beginning of that turn's end step" (Last Chance, Final
  Fortune). Prevented by the `PreventExtraTurns` replacement (Ugin's Nexus).
- `ForceExileMultiZone(count, target)` — exile from hand/battlefield/graveyard combined (Lich's Mastery shape).

### Cards (draw / discard)

- `DrawCards(count, target?)` — draw N (default: controller).
- `DrawUpTo(max, target)` — draw up to N (player picks 0–N).
- "Draw a card and reveal it; if it isn't a [type], discard it" (Sindbad) is a pipeline composition, not
  an effect type: `GatherCards(TopOfLibrary(1), "toDraw")` → `DrawCards(1)` →
  `FilterCollection("toDraw", InZone(HAND), "drawn")` (skips the branch when the draw was replaced or the
  library was empty) → `RevealCollection("drawn", revealToSelf = false)` →
  `FilterCollection(MatchesFilter(Land), storeNonMatching = "notLand")` →
  `MoveCollection("notLand" → graveyard, moveType = Discard)`.
- `Discard(count, target)` — controller-of-target chooses; mandatory. `count` is an `Int` or a
  `DynamicAmount` ("discard X cards, where X is …" — e.g. Converge's Arcane Omens with
  `DynamicAmounts.colorsOfManaSpent()`).
- `EachOpponentDiscards(count)` — each opponent discards N.
- `EachPlayerReturnPermanentToHand()` — each player bounces a permanent.
- `EachPlayerDrawsForDamageDealtToSource()` — each player draws equal to damage source took this turn.
- `ReadTheRunes()` — draw N, then discard N (or sacrifice permanents).
- `ReplaceNextDraw(effect)` — replaces controller's next draw this turn with the given effect (a one-shot
  floating shield, consumed before the replacement runs so an inner `DrawCards` doesn't re-trigger it). The
  activation-time `{X}` is captured onto the shield, so the replacement effect can read `DynamicAmount.XValue`
  when it fires at draw time (Aladdin's Lamp: "look at the top X cards … then draw a card").

### Destruction & exile

- `Destroy(target, noRegenerate?)` — destroy target (respects indestructible). `noRegenerate = true`
  marks the target so it "can't be regenerated" (composes `CantBeRegeneratedEffect` before the move) —
  the single-target analogue of `DestroyAll(noRegenerate = …)`, for Terror / Smother / Tunnel.
- `RegenerateEffect(target)` (raw — no facade) — drop a regeneration shield on `target`, lasting until end
  of turn. The next time `target` would be destroyed this turn, instead tap it, remove all damage marked on
  it, and remove it from combat. Consumed by the first destruction it intercepts.
- `RemoveDamageShieldEffect(target)` (raw — no facade) — Pyramids' second mode. Same shape as regeneration:
  a one-shot destruction shield lasting until end of turn that replaces "destroyed" with "remove all damage
  marked on it". Differs from regeneration in *not* tapping the target and *not* removing it from combat —
  only the marked damage is cleared. The shield isn't a regeneration ability, so a "can't be regenerated"
  marker on the target doesn't disable it. Consumed by the first destruction it intercepts; expires at end
  of turn.
- `DestroyAll(filter, noRegenerate?, storeDestroyedAs?, excludeTriggering?)` — destroy all matching; optionally
  save the ID list for follow-up. `excludeTriggering = true` spares the triggering entity, for "destroy all
  *other* … with it" triggers (Spreading Plague).
- `DestroyAllAndAttached(filter, noRegenerate?)` — also destroys auras/equipment on the matching permanents.
- `DestroyLeastPowerCreature(noRegenerate?)` — destroy the creature with the least power among **all**
  creatures on the battlefield (global, both players). On a tie for least power the controller chooses which
  one dies (Drop of Honey). Backed by the `GameObjectFilter.Creature.hasLeastPowerAmongAllCreatures()` filter
  (`StatePredicate.HasLeastPowerAmongAllCreatures`) gathered, then a `ChooseExactly(1)` selection that
  auto-resolves when the minimum is unique.
- `DestroyCreaturesBlockingOrBlockedBySource(noRegenerate?)` — destroy the creatures blocking, or blocked by,
  the effect's source (CR 509 combat pairing), using the pairing **last known when the source left the
  battlefield**. For "when ~ dies, destroy all creatures blocking or blocked by it" (Abu Ja'far): the live
  combat cross-references are already torn down by the time a dies trigger resolves, so the pairing is read
  from the leaves-battlefield snapshot (`ZoneChangeEvent.lastKnownBlockingOrBlockedByIds` →
  `EffectContext.triggerLastKnownBlockingOrBlockedByIds`) via `CardSource.LastKnownCombatPairedWithSource`,
  restricted to creatures still on the battlefield.
- `DestroyAllEquipmentOnTarget(target)` — wreck the gear attached to a creature.
- `Exile(target)` — exile target.
- `ExileAndGrantOwnerPlayPermission(target, until?)` — exile + owner may play it (Garth-style).
- `ExileOpponentsGraveyards()` — exile every card in each opponent's graveyard.
- `ExileUntilLeaves(target)` — linked exile; returns when source leaves the battlefield.
- `ExileLinkedToSource(target)` — exile a target **permanently** and record it in the source's linked-exile pile (`LinkedExileComponent`). Unlike `ExileUntilLeaves` there's no automatic return — the link just lets later abilities reference the exiled card (Territory Forge's "this permanent has all activated abilities of the exiled card").
- `ExileGroupAndLink(filter, storeAs?)` — exile all matching permanents into source's linked exile pile.
- `ExileFromTopRepeating(count, repeatCondition)` — keep exiling top cards while a condition holds.
- `ExileLibraryUntilManaValue(manaValue)` — exile from library until mana value ≤ N.

### Return / placement

- `ReturnToHand(target)` — bounce to hand.
- `PutOnTopOfLibrary(target)` — place target on top of its owner's library.
- `PutOnBottomOfLibrary(target)` — place target on the bottom of its owner's library (forced, no choice).
- `PutOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary(target)` — player chooses top or bottom.
- `PutSecondFromTopOrBottomOfLibrary(target)` — second-from-top or bottom.
- `ShuffleIntoLibrary(target)` — shuffle target into owner's library.
- `PutIntoLibraryNthFromTop(target, positionFromTop)` — place N from the top.
- `PutOntoBattlefield(target, tapped?)` — put target on the battlefield.
- `PutOntoBattlefieldUnderYourControl(target)` — under controller's control.
- `PutOntoBattlefieldFaceDown(count, target?)` — enter face-down (2/2 morph shape).
- `PutOntoBattlefieldAttachedToChosen(target, hostFilter?)` — put a targeted Aura or Equipment onto the
  battlefield attached to a permanent the controller chooses at resolution (default host filter: a creature
  you control). Works for both Auras and Equipment; the host is chosen, not targeted. If no legal host exists,
  an Equipment enters unattached while an Aura can't enter (Rule 303.4g). (One Last Job.)
- `ReturnSelfToBattlefieldAttached(target)` — return source attached to target (Aura recursion).
- `ReturnSelfFromExileTransformed` — Craft resolution (CR 702.167a). Returns the source from exile to the
  battlefield as its back face, under its owner's control, and re-attaches the source's
  `CraftedFromExiledComponent` recording the exiled materials. Pair with `AbilityCost.Craft`; see the `Craft`
  keyword helper in the keyword catalog.
- `ReturnCreaturesPutInGraveyardThisTurn(player)` — Patriarch's Bidding shape.

### Hand reveal

- `Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand(filter, otherwise?)` — atomic "you may reveal a `filter`
  card from your hand" choice. Computes eligible hand cards; if none, runs `otherwise`
  silently; otherwise prompts the controller with a `SelectCardsDecision` (min=0, max=1).
  Revealing emits a `CardsRevealedEvent` and stops; declining (or empty selection) runs
  `otherwise`. Compose with `Effects.Tap`/`Effects.Sacrifice`/etc. via `otherwise` to
  express "if you don't, X" riders — e.g. SOI shadow lands wrap this in
  `OnEnterRunEffect(...)` with `otherwise = Effects.Tap(EffectTarget.Self)` for the
  "this land enters tapped" branch.
- `Effects.Behold(filter, ifBeheld?)` — resolution-time **behold** (`BeholdEffect`): "you may
  behold a `filter`. If you do, `ifBeheld`." The behold itself is optional — the controller may
  choose a matching permanent they control **or** reveal a matching card from hand (revealing emits
  `CardsRevealedEvent`; battlefield permanents are merely chosen). If they decline, or control no
  matching permanent and hold no matching card, `ifBeheld` does not run. Distinct from the cast-time
  `AdditionalCost.Behold` / `AdditionalCost.BeholdOrPay` (which behold as a casting cost). Sarkhan,
  Dragon Ascendant ETB: `Effects.Behold(GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(Subtype.DRAGON),
  ifBeheld = Effects.CreateTreasure())`.

### Library reveal & free cast

- `Effects.Cascade` — CR 702.85a (`CascadeEffect`). Exile from the top of the controller's library
  until a nonland card with mana value **strictly less than** the triggering spell's is exiled,
  offer to cast it for free, bottom-randomize every exiled card that isn't cast.
- `RevealAndMayCastFromLibraryEffect(count, maxManaValue, player?)` — Sunbird's Invocation
  shape. Reveal top `count` cards of `player`'s library, present a `SELECT_CARDS` prompt over
  the revealed nonland cards with mana value ≤ `maxManaValue` (player picks 0 or 1), free-cast
  the chosen card if any, bottom-randomize the rest. Pair with `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()`
  (= `EntityProperty(Triggering, ManaValue)`) when both bounds come from the triggering spell.

### Linked exile & play-from-exile permissions

- `ReturnLinkedExile()` — return all from source's linked exile, under controller.
- `ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl()` — return under each card's owner.
- `ReturnLinkedExileToHand()` — return all from linked exile to hand.
- `ReturnOneFromLinkedExile()` — return one chosen card.
- `GrantMayPlayFromExile(from, expiry?, withAnyManaType?, condition?, landEntersTapped?, onPlayRider?, ownerControls?, exileAfterResolve?)` — controller may play matching cards from exile. `exileAfterResolve=true` stamps `ExileAfterResolveComponent` on each granted card so a spell cast from the permission is exiled instead of going to a graveyard (on resolution, when countered, or when it fizzles) — the "If that spell would be put into a graveyard, exile it instead" rider on borrow-a-spell-you-don't-own cards (Nita, Forum Conciliator); the same mechanism as `GrantFreeCastTargetFromExile.exileAfterResolve` but for a *paid* cast. `withAnyManaType=true` relaxes the colored pips so mana of any type can pay them (Laughing Jasper Flint, Cruelclaw's Heist); the grant works whether the card stays in exile *or* in a graveyard (Tinybones, the Pickpocket grants over a card the trigger gathered straight from a graveyard via `CardSource.ChosenTargets`), and the relaxation is applied both in the legal-action enumerator and in the cast handler's payment. `landEntersTapped=true` forces a played land tapped regardless of its own ETB script (Lightstall Inquisitor); PlayLandHandler reads the flag off the active `MayPlayPermission` at play time and stamps `TappedComponent` before the card's intrinsic `EntersTapped` branch runs. `onPlayRider` is a "When you play a card this way, …" payoff: the engine registers a linked event-based delayed triggered ability alongside the permission, and casting/playing a granted card emits a `CardPlayedFromPermissionEvent` (link-id-scoped, like `DamagePreventedEvent`) that fires the rider on the stack as a triggered ability of the granting source. Expires with the grant (end of turn). Used by Fires of Mount Doom ("…When you play a card this way, Fires of Mount Doom deals 2 damage to each player."). `ownerControls=true` grants the permission to each exiled card's *owner* instead of the effect controller — the collection is grouped by owner into one permission per owner, and any turn-keyed `expiry` (e.g. `MayPlayExpiry.UntilEndOfNextTurn`) is measured against each owner's own turns. Use for "for each of those cards, its owner may play it until the end of their next turn" wording where the exiled cards may belong to different players (Suspend Aggression: exile a target nonland permanent + your top library card, each owner may replay the one they own). Mirrors `MakePlottedEffect.ownerControls`; prefer it (composed in a gather → exile → grant pipeline) over the monolithic `ExileAndGrantOwnerPlayPermission` when the expiry is turn-bounded or more than one card is exiled.
- `GrantPlayWithoutPayingCost(from)` — same, without paying mana costs.
- `GrantPlayWithCostIncrease(from, amount)` — stamp `PlayWithCostIncreaseComponent(controllerId, amount)` on every card in the collection, so the next cast pays `{amount}` extra generic. Pair with `GrantMayPlayFromExile` for "each spell cast this way costs {N} more" clauses (Lightstall Inquisitor); for target-based "exile this permanent, owner may play it, opponents tax" effects use `Effects.ExileAndGrantOwnerPlayPermission` instead.
- `GrantFreeCastTargetFromExile(target)` — cast specific exiled card for free.
- `MakePlotted(from, ownerControls = false)` — make every card in the named collection *plotted* (CR 718). The cards must already be in exile (chain after a `MoveCollection` to `Zone.EXILE`). Each card gets the plotted designation (`PlottedComponent`) + a permanent free-cast-as-a-sorcery-on-a-later-turn permission (`PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent` + `MayPlayPermission` gated by `SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`) — the Plot keyword's state without a plot cost. Emits a `CardPlottedEvent` per card so "when this card becomes plotted" triggers fire. No-ops on an empty collection (so an optional "you may exile … it becomes plotted" fork is safe). With `ownerControls = true` the free-cast permission goes to each card's **owner** rather than the effect's controller (CR 718.2 — for "exile target spell, it becomes plotted" the spell's owner casts it later, not the plotter); default is controller-controls (you plot a card you own, like Make Your Own Luck).

### Stats & keywords

- `ModifyStats(power, toughness, target?)` — `±P/±T` until end of turn (default scope).
- `SetBasePower(target, power: DynamicAmount, duration)` — set base power to a dynamic value (Layer 7b).
- `SetBasePowerAndToughness(power, toughness, target?, duration)` — set base power AND toughness to
  fixed values (Layer 7b, set values), e.g. "Target creature has base power and toughness 5/5 until end
  of turn" (Dreadful as the Storm). Backed by `SetBasePowerToughnessEffect`.
- `GrantKeyword(keyword, target, duration)` — grant a keyword for a duration.
- `GrantStaticAbility(ability, target, duration)` — grant a printed-shape `StaticAbility` (e.g. `CantBeBlockedByMoreThan(1)`) to a permanent for a duration. The runtime sibling of a printed static ability: unlike keyword grants (which flow through projected keywords) it is recorded as a `GrantedStaticAbility` keyed to the entity in `GameState.grantedStaticAbilities` and read **at the point of use** — combat blocker validation (`BlockPhaseManager`, CR 509.1b) consults granted `CantBeBlockedByMoreThan` alongside the creature's printed static abilities; the grant expires in the cleanup step (EndOfTurn). Compose inside `ForEachInGroup` with `EffectTarget.Self` for "each creature you control gains ..." (Full Steam Ahead = `ModifyStats(2,2)` + `GrantKeyword(TRAMPLE)` + `GrantStaticAbility(CantBeBlockedByMoreThan(1))`). Only `CantBeBlockedByMoreThan` is wired into a read site today; granting another `StaticAbility` kind compiles and stores but needs its own point-of-use read to take effect.
- `GrantHarmonize(target, cost?, duration)` — grant **Harmonize** (CR 702.180) to a target instant/sorcery card in a graveyard. `cost` defaults to `null` = "equal to the card's mana cost" (Songcrafter Mage); pass a `ManaCost` for a fixed harmonize cost. Records a runtime `GrantedKeywordAbility` keyed to the card entity; the cast-from-graveyard enumerator, the cast handler, the alternative-payment handler (tap-for-power reduction), and the stack resolver (exile on resolution) all read printed-or-granted harmonize through the shared `HarmonizeGrants` resolver, so a granted harmonize behaves identically to a printed one. The grant expires in the cleanup step (EndOfTurn) and surfaces a "Granted Ability" badge on the card.
- `GrantFlashback(target, cost?, duration)` — grant **Flashback** (CR 702.34) to a target instant/sorcery card in a graveyard. The runtime sibling of printed `KeywordAbility.Flashback`, modelled exactly like `GrantHarmonize`. `cost` defaults to `null` = "equal to the card's mana cost" (Archmage's Newt); pass a `ManaCost` for a fixed flashback cost (e.g. `{0}` on a saddled-Mount branch). Records a runtime `GrantedKeywordAbility` keyed to the card entity; the cast-from-graveyard enumerator, the cast handler / `CastZoneResolver`, and the stack resolver (exile on resolution) read printed-**or**-granted flashback through the shared `FlashbackGrants.effectiveFlashback` resolver, so a granted flashback is castable and exiled exactly like a printed one. The grant survives the graveyard → stack move and expires in the cleanup step (EndOfTurn). Pair with `ConditionalEffect(Conditions.SourceIsSaddled, GrantFlashback(t, {0}), elseEffect = GrantFlashback(t))` for the saddled-or-not cost swap.
- `RemoveKeyword(keyword, target, duration)` — strip a keyword.
- `RemoveAllAbilities(target, duration)` — wipe all abilities (including granted keywords).
- `LoseAllCreatureTypes(target, duration)` — remove all creature subtypes.
- `SetCreatureSubtypes(subtypes, target, duration)` — replace subtypes outright.
- `AddCreatureType(subtype, target, duration)` — additive subtype.
- `GrantHexproof(target, duration)` — temporary hexproof.
- `GrantExileOnLeave(target)` — "if it would leave, exile instead".
- `GrantKeywordToAttackersBlockedBy(keyword, target)` — grant keyword to creatures this blocks.

### Counters

- `AddCounters(type, count, target)` — add N counters of `type`.
- `AddDynamicCounters(type, amount, target)` — count is computed at resolution.
- `DoubleCounters(type?, target?)` — one-shot doubling of the `type` counters (default `+1/+1`) already on the
  target: reads the current count and places that many more (so the total doubles). Distinct from the
  `DoubleCounterPlacement` replacement (which doubles *future* placements); the added counters still trigger
  placement replacements like Hardened Scales. No-op with zero counters. Sage of the Fang.
- `GrantCounterPlacementModifier(modifier?, duration?, counterType?, recipient?)` — install a **temporary,
  duration-scoped, controller-scoped** counter-placement modifier: the activated/spell-granted analogue of the
  static `ModifyCounterPlacement` replacement (Hardened Scales). While active, if the *controller* of the effect
  would put `counterType` counters (default `+1/+1`) on a recipient matching `recipient` (default
  `RecipientFilter.CreatureYouControl`, resolved relative to that controller), `modifier` additional counters
  (default `+1`) are placed instead. Recorded in a turn-scoped store on the game state and consulted from the
  single counter-placement chokepoint (so every AddCounters-style effect honors it); expires per `duration`
  (default `Duration.EndOfTurn`) via end-of-turn cleanup. Negative `modifier` reduces (floored at 0). Prairie Dog
  (OTJ): "{4}{W}: Until end of turn, if you would put one or more +1/+1 counters on a creature you control, put
  that many plus one +1/+1 counters on it instead." → `GrantCounterPlacementModifier()` with all defaults.
- `RemoveCounters(type, count, target)` — remove N counters.
- `RemoveAnyNumberOfCounters(target)` — player removes 0 or more.
- `RemoveAllCounters(target)` — wipe every counter.
- `RemoveAllCountersOfType(type, target)` — wipe one kind.
- `MoveAllLastKnownCounters(target)` — Hooded Hydra / Essence Channeler — move every counter kind from source's
  last-known state.
- `MoveCountersEachKindMissing(source, destination)` — Goldberry, River-Daughter (ability A) — for each counter
  kind on `source` that `destination` does not already have, move one of that kind from `source` onto
  `destination`. Deterministic, no player choice; kinds the destination already has are left untouched.
- `MoveChosenCountersToTarget(source, destination, drawCardOnMove?)` — Goldberry, River-Daughter (ability B) —
  player chooses how many of each kind to move from `source` onto `destination` (one `ChooseNumberDecision` per
  kind). When `drawCardOnMove` is true, the controller draws a card if any counter was moved ("if you do, draw").
- `MoveCounters(counterType, amount, source, destination)` — Tester of the Tangential — deterministic,
  count-carrying move of a single counter kind: moves `amount` (a `DynamicAmount`, e.g. `DynamicAmount.XValue`
  from a may-pay-{X} reflexive) of `counterType` from `source` onto `destination`. The count is capped at the
  number actually on `source`, and adding to `destination` honors counter-placement replacement effects
  (Hardened Scales). No-op when source/destination missing, they're the same permanent, amount ≤ 0, or source has
  none of that kind. The count-fixed counterpart to the interactive `MoveChosenCountersToTarget`.
- `Counters.ANY` — wildcard counter-type string for "counters of any type" triggers/events (e.g.
  `Triggers.countersPlacedOn`); not a real placeable counter, only a matcher sentinel.
- `DistributeCountersFromSelf(type?, count?)` — split source's counters among creatures you control.
- `DistributeCountersAmongTargets(total, type?, minPerTarget?)` — divvy N counters among chosen targets.
- `Proliferate()` — add one counter of each kind already present on chosen permanents/players (CR 701.27).
- `AddCountersToCollection(name, type, count)` — add counters to cards held in a pipeline collection.
  An overload takes a `DynamicAmount` instead of an `Int` count, evaluated once at resolution — "create
  a token, then put X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is …" over the `CREATED_TOKENS` collection (Emil,
  Vastlands Roamer).

### Color & type

- `AddCardType(type, target, duration)` — add a card type (e.g. become an artifact).
- `AddSubtype(subtype, target, duration)` — add a subtype temporarily.
- `SetLandType(landType, target, duration, fromChosenValueKey)` — target land *becomes* the basic land type, **replacing** its existing land subtypes (Rule 305.7); pass `fromChosenValueKey` to read the type from a preceding `ChooseOption(OptionType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE)`. One-shot counterpart to the `SetEnchantedLandType` aura static ability. (Dream Thrush)
- `ChooseColorForTarget(target)` — target picks a color; stored in context.
- `BecomeChosenManaColor(target)` — adopt the previously chosen color.
- `ChangeColor(colors, target, duration)` — replace colors with the given set.
- `BecomeAllColors(target, duration)` — five-color until end of turn.
- `ChangeColorToChosen(target, duration)` — replace the target's colors with the single color picked
  by a preceding `ChooseColorThen` (read from `EffectContext.chosenColor`). The target may be a
  **spell on the stack** or a permanent — the color projection reads the recolored entry in both
  zones, so a recolored spell's new color drives color-matching checks (e.g. protection) during
  resolution. Compose as `ChooseColorThen(then = ChangeColorToChosen(target))` for "target ...
  becomes the color of your choice" (Blind Seer).
- `ChangeWordInText(target, duration)` — Layer-3 text change: the player picks one **color word**
  or **basic land type** on the target and a replacement of the same category, recorded as a
  `TextReplacement` on the target. A basic-land-type swap flows through the projected type line, so
  the land's mana (via `IntrinsicManaAbilities`), landwalk relevance, and type checks all follow
  automatically (Forest→Island taps for `{U}`); a color-word swap rewrites protection-from-color and
  `HasColor`/`NotColor` filters. `duration = EndOfTurn` is stripped at cleanup; `Permanent` is the
  Artificial-Evolution-style indefinite change. The player picks the FROM and TO words on **one
  screen** (a `ChooseReplacementDecision`), with words **present on the target** surfaced first
  (labeled "On <card>") so a no-op pick is discouraged, and a live `from → to` preview. (Crystal Spray)

### Mana

- `AddMana(color, amount, restriction?, expiry?)` — add N of one color. `expiry` is a `ManaExpiry`
  (default `END_OF_TURN`); set `END_OF_COMBAT` for firebending-style combat-duration mana that the
  pool keeps through combat and discards when combat ends. Combat-duration mana is stored as an
  `AnySpend` restricted entry (so it spends like any other mana) and cleared by
  `CombatManager.endCombat`. See [ManaExpiry](#manaexpiry).
- `AddColorlessMana(amount, restriction?)` — add colorless.
- `AddManaOfChoice(colorSet, amount?, restriction?, riders?)` — **unified primitive.** Add N mana of one color the controller picks from a resolved [ManaColorSet](#manacolorset). All "any-color from a constrained pool" cards (any color, commander identity, among permanents, lands could produce, source-chosen color) are expressed as this effect plus a different `ManaColorSet`. `riders` is a `Set<ManaSpellRider>` consumed when the mana pays for a spell (e.g. Path of Ancestry tags its mana with `ScryOnSharedTypeWithCommander`); when riders are set without a `restriction`, the engine stores the entries under `ManaRestriction.AnySpend` to preserve the rider through the pool.
- `AddAnyColorMana(amount?, restriction?)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.AnyColor, amount)`. "Add N mana of any **one** color" (Gilded Lotus): one chosen color, N of it. For "any **combination** of colors" use `AddManaInAnyCombination`.
- `AddManaOfChosenColor(amount?)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.SourceChosenColor, amount)`.
- `AddManaOfColorAmong(filter)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.AmongPermanents(filter))`.
- `AddManaOfColorAmongGraveyard(filter)` — one mana of any color among cards in your graveyard matching
  `filter` (reads each card's base colors; sugar for `ManaColorSet.AmongCardsInGraveyard(filter)`). The
  Grey Havens ("any color among legendary creature cards in your graveyard").
- `AddManaOfColorLandsCouldProduce(scope)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.LandsCouldProduce(scope))`. Fellwar Stone / Exotic Orchard / Reflecting Pool shape.
- `AddManaOfColorInCommanderColorIdentity()` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.CommanderIdentity)`. Arcane Signet / Command Tower shape.
- `AddAnyColorManaSpendOnChosenType(typeName)` — mana that can only pay for a specific card type (kept separate because it derives a runtime [ManaRestriction] from the source's chosen subtype).
- `AddDynamicMana(amount, allowedColors, restriction?)` — split X across a fixed color set, distinct from `AddManaOfChoice` because it distributes the full X total across multiple colors rather than producing X copies of one chosen color.
- `AddManaInAnyCombination(amount, allowedColors?, restriction?)` — "Add N mana in any combination of colors" (Wizard's Rockets, Thornvault Forager, Interdimensional Web Watch). Sugar for `AddDynamicMana`; `allowedColors` defaults to all five. The controller colors **each** pip independently at resolution (3+ colors → pip-by-pip color choice; 2 colors → one "how much of the first" prompt; ≤0 → no mana, no prompt), so the result can mix colors — distinct from `AddAnyColorMana`, where all N share one color.
- `AddOneManaOfEachColorAmong(filter)` — one mana of *each* color found among matching permanents (Bloom Tender shape).
- `PayDynamicMana(amount, payer?, color?)` — pay a dynamically-computed amount of mana at resolution; the
  dynamic, payer-parametric twin of the flat `PayManaCostEffect`. `amount` is a [DynamicAmount](#dynamicamount)
  evaluated at resolution (0 pays nothing and succeeds); `payer` is a `Player` reference defaulting to the
  controller (`Player.You`). `color` defaults to null (pay `amount` **generic** mana); set it to a `Color` to pay
  `amount` copies of that **colored** symbol instead — `color = Color.GREEN` → `{G}{G}…`, for "pay {G} for each
  wind counter" (Cyclone). Affordability and the prompt label honor the color. This is the building block for **"pay {N} for each X"** templating — pair it with a
  pipeline selection and read the selection size via `DynamicAmount.Multiply(DynamicAmount.VariableReference("<collection>_count"), N)`
  — and for **"that player pays"** on each-player triggers (`payer = Player.TriggeringPlayer`, the only effect that
  charges a player other than the ability's controller). Affordability is recognized by `Gate.MayPay`, so wrapping
  it in a may-pay gate skips the prompt when the payer can't afford the computed cost, and the gate's "yes" button
  renders the *computed* total ("Pay {8}"), not the formula. When the amount scales with an upstream selection,
  put `SelectionRestriction.MaxAffordablePayment(manaPerSelected, payer)` on the selection so the player can't pick
  a set they can't pay for. Magnetic Mountain ("pay {4} for each tapped blue creature chosen, untap them") composes
  all three: the capped selection, then the dynamic cost in a `Gate.MayPay` whose `decisionMaker` is the same
  `Player.TriggeringPlayer`.

### Tokens & emblems

- `CreateToken(p, t, colors?, creatureTypes, keywords?, count?, controller?, imageUri?, legendary?, tapped?, artifactToken?, enchantmentToken?)` — make N creature tokens.
  `artifactToken = true` makes them **artifact** creatures and `enchantmentToken = true` makes them **enchantment**
  creatures (both may be set at once); the extra card type is unioned onto the token's `Creature` type line (e.g.
  Duskmourn's Glimmer cards create a "1/1 white Glimmer enchantment creature token" via `enchantmentToken = true`).
  `count` accepts an `Int` or a `DynamicAmount` (the latter for "create X tokens" wording — e.g. Verdeloth the
  Ancient passes `count = DynamicAmount.XValue` to make X Saprolings when kicked). Publishes the created token
  entity IDs to the `CREATED_TOKENS` pipeline collection, so a sibling effect in a `CompositeEffect` can address
  each token via `EffectTarget.PipelineTarget(CREATED_TOKENS, index)` — e.g. Mardu Monument grants menace and haste
  until end of turn to each of its three freshly-created Warriors with one `GrantKeyword` per token. For a *named*
  token (creature or otherwise) with its own abilities — Treasure, Munitions, Cragflame — add a `CardDefinition`
  to `PredefinedTokens.kt` and expose an `Effects.Create<Name>Token()` facade that wraps
  `CreatePredefinedTokenEffect("<Name>", count)`. The predefined-token registry already supports noncreature type
  lines (e.g. Munitions' `typeLine = "Artifact"`) and embedded triggered abilities. For a count computed at
  resolution rather than a fixed integer, pass `dynamicCount = <DynamicAmount>` instead of `count` — the executor
  evaluates it (coerced to ≥ 0) and creates that many tokens (Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, LTR: "create X Treasure
  tokens, where X is the exiled card's power", via `DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(Target(0), Power)`).
  For an *inline* token (not a registered `CardDefinition`) that has its own abilities, the raw
  `CreateTokenEffect` constructor exposes `staticAbilities`, `triggeredAbilities`, **and**
  `activatedAbilities` — each list is granted to every created token at resolution (permanent
  duration) via `GameState.granted{Static,Triggered,Activated}Abilities`, so the legal-action
  enumerator and `ActivateAbilityHandler` pick them up like any other granted ability. Example:
  Mourner's Surprise's "1/1 red Mercenary creature token with \"{T}: Target creature you control
  gets +1/+0 until end of turn. Activate only as a sorcery.\"" passes a single
  `ActivatedAbility(cost = AbilityCost.Tap, effect = Effects.ModifyStats(1, 0), targetRequirements =
  listOf(Targets.CreatureYouControl), timing = TimingRule.SorcerySpeed)`. (Remember a token is a
  creature, so a `{T}` ability is summoning-sick the turn the token enters.)
- `CreateDynamicToken(dynamicPower, dynamicToughness, colors?, creatureTypes, keywords?, count?, controller?, imageUri?)` —
  tokens whose P/T is computed at resolution (e.g. Pure Reflection's X/X Reflection where X = the cast spell's mana
  value, via `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()`). `controller` directs who gets the token (e.g.
  `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.TriggeringPlayer)` for "that player creates …"); `imageUri` sets custom token art.
- `CreateTokenOfChosenColorAndType(dynamicPower, dynamicToughness, count?)` — a token whose **color and
  creature type are the ones the source locked into its cast-choice slots** (`ChoiceSlot.COLOR` /
  `ChoiceSlot.CREATURE_TYPE`), read off the source's `CastChoicesComponent` at resolution. Riptide
  Replicator: "create an X/X creature token of the chosen color and type." (Replaces the old one-off
  `CreateChosenTokenEffect`; under the hood it sets `CreateTokenEffect.colorsFromChoice` /
  `creatureTypesFromChoice`.)
- `CreateTokenCopyOfSelf(count?, tapped?)` — token copies of source.
- `CreateTokenCopyOfTarget(target, count?, overridePower?, overrideToughness?, tapped?, attacking?, triggeredAbilities?, addedKeywords?, addedSupertypes?, removedSupertypes?, overrideColors?, overrideSubtypes?, addedSubtypes?, overrideCardTypes?, activatedAbilities?, sacrificeAtStep?, sacrificeOnlyOnControllersTurn?, addCardTypes?, exileAtStep?, exileUnlessSourceIsRingBearer?, controller?)` —
  token copy of another permanent (or a card in any zone — the executor copies the target's `CardComponent`,
  so a graveyard/exile card works; pass `EffectTarget.PipelineTarget("name")` to copy a card a prior pipeline
  step exiled/stored, as Nexus of Becoming and Mardu Siegebreaker do).
  `overrideColors`/`overrideSubtypes` replace the copy's colors/subtypes
  outright for "a token that's a copy … except it's a 5/5 black Demon" wording (Ardyn, the Usurper).
  `addedSubtypes` *unions* extra subtypes onto the copy (vs `overrideSubtypes` which replaces) — e.g.
  Nexus of Becoming's "a 3/3 Golem … in addition to its other types".
  `addCardTypes` (e.g. `setOf("ARTIFACT")`) *unions* extra card types onto the copy's type line for the
  "except it's a [type] in addition to its other types" clause (the targeted sibling of
  `CreateTokenCopyOfSource`'s `addCardTypes`; Molten Duplication, Nexus of Becoming).
  `overrideCardTypes` replaces the copy's card types outright — "it's a Food artifact … and it loses all
  other card types" → `setOf(CardType.ARTIFACT)`; `activatedAbilities` grants extra activated abilities to
  the copy (the Food "{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this token: You gain 3 life") — together model Shelob, Child of
  Ungoliant's death-trigger Food token.
  `attacking` only applies to copies whose printed type line is a creature (a copy of a non-creature card
  still enters tapped but never attacking). `sacrificeAtStep` schedules one delayed `SacrificeTargetEffect`
  per created copy at that step (the sacrifice sibling of `CreateTokenEffect.sacrificeAtStep`);
  `sacrificeOnlyOnControllersTurn = true` restricts it to "at the beginning of *your* next end step"
  (Mardu Siegebreaker: a tapped+attacking copy of the linked-exiled card, sacrificed at your next end step).
  `exileAtStep` is the *exile* sibling — it schedules one delayed `MoveToZoneEffect(token, EXILE)` per copy
  at that step (the next matching step of any player's turn, "the next end step"). When
  `exileUnlessSourceIsRingBearer = true` that exile is wrapped in `Gate.WhenCondition(SourceIsRingBearer)`
  so it is skipped while the source is the controller's Ring-bearer at fire time (CR 701.54e) — "create a
  tapped and attacking token that's a copy of that card … at the beginning of the next end step, exile that
  token unless ~ is your Ring-bearer" (Sauron, the Necromancer).
  `controller` (an `EffectTarget` player ref) overrides who creates — and so controls and owns — the token;
  `null` defaults to the effect's controller. Set it for "**Target player** creates a token that's a copy of
  target creature you control" (Echocasting Symposium): the chosen creature is copied but the token enters
  under the named player's control. Mirrors `CreateTokenEffect.controller`.
  Like `CreateToken`, both `CreateTokenCopyOfTarget` and `CreateTokenCopyOfSource` publish their created token
  entity IDs to the `CREATED_TOKENS` pipeline collection, so a sibling effect in a `CompositeEffect` can address
  the new copy — e.g. Applied Geometry's "Create a token that's a copy … Put six +1/+1 counters on it" composes
  `CreateTokenCopyOfTarget(...)` then `AddCountersToCollection(CREATED_TOKENS, "+1/+1", 6)`.
- `CreateTokenCopyOfEquippedCreature(count?, tapped?)` — equipment-specific copy.
- `CreateRandomCreatureTokenWithManaValue(manaValue)` — create a token that's a copy of a *randomly
  chosen* creature card whose mana value equals `manaValue` (the Momir Basic Vanguard avatar's payoff —
  "Momir Vig, Simic Visionary": `{X}, Discard a card`). The candidate pool is the active
  `Format.MomirBasic.eligibleCreatureNames` (every creature across all sets, stored pre-sorted for
  replay-stable RNG); the executor filters it to `cmc == manaValue`, picks
  one with the game's seeded `GameRng`, and mints a token copy via `TokenFromDefinition` (the minting
  path for a bare `CardDefinition`, sibling to the in-zone token-copy path). If no creature has that
  mana value, nothing is created (the cost was still paid). The minted token's own `{X}` reads 0 — it
  never went on the stack. Pass `DynamicAmount.XValue` for "mana value X".
- `CreateTreasure(count?, tapped?)` — Treasure tokens. `count` accepts an `Int` or a `DynamicAmount`
  (the latter evaluated at resolution, e.g. `CreateTreasure(DynamicAmounts.sourcePower(), tapped = true)`
  for Goldvein Hydra's "create a number of tapped Treasure tokens equal to its power").
- `CreateFood(count?, controller?)` — Food tokens.
- `CreateBlood(count?, controller?)` — Blood tokens (artifact with "{1}, {T}, Discard a card, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.").
- `CreateClue(count?, controller?)` / `Investigate(count?, controller?)` — Clue tokens (artifact with
  "{2}, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card."). `Investigate` is the keyword-action spelling (CR 701.36) so
  card text "investigate" maps directly; both create the same predefined `Clue` token — Malcolm, the Eyes.
- `CreateLander(count?, controller?)` — Lander land tokens.
- `CreateMeteorite(count?, tapped?, controller?)` — Meteorite tokens (Roxanne, Starfall Savant): a
  colorless artifact with "When this token enters, it deals 2 damage to any target." and "{T}: Add
  one mana of any color." Roxanne creates them `tapped = true`.
- `CreateMutavault(count?, tapped?, controller?)` — Mutavault tokens.
- `CreateRoleToken(roleName, target)` — attach a Role aura token.
- `CreateMapToken(count?)` — Map artifact tokens.
- `CreateDroneToken(count?)` — Drone tokens.
- `CreateMunitionsToken(count?)` — Munitions noncreature artifact tokens (Weapons Manufacturing); the LTB damage
  trigger lives on the predefined `Munitions` `CardDefinition` and is picked up automatically by the engine's
  `TriggerAbilityResolver`.
- `CreatePermanentEmblem(name, abilities)` — planeswalker emblem with static abilities.

### Ability granting

- `GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect(ability)` — permanently grant a triggered ability.
- `CreateGlobalTriggeredAbility(ability, duration = Duration.Permanent, descriptionOverride? = null)` — engine-wide triggered ability with no source permanent. `duration` is a plain parameter, so the one method covers every lifetime: `Duration.EndOfTurn` (False Cure, Death Frenzy), `Duration.UntilYourNextTurn` (Season of the Bold), `Duration.EndOfCombat`, `Duration.Permanent` (Dimensional Breach, planeswalker emblems), etc. `descriptionOverride` sets emblem display text.
- `GrantSpellKeywordEffect` — grant a keyword to a spell on the stack.
- `GrantSpellsCantBeCountered(target, filter, duration)` — target's matching spells become uncounterable (Domri shape).
- `GrantFlashToSpells(target, spellFilter, duration)` — target may cast matching spells as though they had flash (CR 702.8a) for `duration` (default `EndOfTurn`). Resolution-time one-shot that records the grant on the player and survives the source spell leaving the stack. Used by **Borne Upon a Wind** ("You may cast spells this turn as though they had flash."); narrower filters like `GameObjectFilter.Sorcery` cover "you may cast sorcery spells as though they had flash" variants. Sibling of the permanent-static [`GrantFlashToSpellType`](#9-static-abilities) — use the static for "as long as this is on the battlefield" wording (the two Gandalfs); use this Effect for a turn-scoped or duration-bounded grant.

### Control & combat

- `GainControlEffect(target, duration)` — gain control until end of turn (default). Pair with
  `Duration.WhileSourceTapped` (Callous Oppressor) or
  `Duration.WhileSourceTappedAndAffectedPowerAtMostSource` (Old Man of the Sea) for the classic
  "for as long as this creature remains tapped [and the stolen creature's power stays ≤ source's
  power]" steal pattern, or `Duration.WhileYouControlSource("<source name>")` for the
  "for as long as you control this [permanent]" pattern (Aladdin, Scroll of Isildur Chapter I,
  Rangers of Ithilien), or `Duration.WhileSourceAttachedToAffected` for "gain control … for as
  long as that Aura is attached to it" (Eriette, the Beguiler — the effect is sourced from the
  *Aura*, so the executor swaps the floating effect's source to the triggering attachment, and the
  control ends the instant the Aura leaves, detaches, or re-attaches elsewhere). `StateProjector`
  gates these per-frame for the instantaneous view; the
  one-way half of CR 611.2b ("for as long as" durations don't restart) is enforced by the
  `EndedDurationExpiryCheck` state-based action, which physically removes the effect the moment
  the condition fails — so a pump that wears off, a re-tap, or a re-acquired source never
  re-grabs the creature.
- `ExchangeControlEffect(target1, target2)` — swap control of two permanents.
- `GainControlByMostEffect(metric, target?)` — the player with strictly the most of a `PlayerRankMetric` takes it (tie = no change). Metrics: `PlayerRankMetric.LifeTotal` (Ghazbán Ogre), `PlayerRankMetric.CreaturesOfSubtype(subtype)` (Thoughtbound Primoc). Facades: `Effects.GainControlByMostLife()`, `Effects.GainControlByMostOfSubtype(subtype)`.
- `GiftGivenEffect(target)` — "gift" temporary control.
- `CantAttackEffect(target, unless?)` — target can't attack.
- `CantBlockEffect(target, unless?)` — target can't block.
- `CantAttackGroupEffect(filter, condition?)` — group-scoped can't-attack.
- `CantBlockGroupEffect(filter, condition?)` — group-scoped can't-block.
- `Effects.Suspect(target)` — target becomes Suspected (MKM keyword). Composite: `SetSuspectedEffect` (named status, CR 701.60d dedup) + `GrantKeywordEffect(MENACE)` + `CantBlockEffect`.
- `RemoveFromCombatEffect(target, unblockSoleBlockedAttackers = false)` — yank target out of combat.
  Set `unblockSoleBlockedAttackers = true` for the old-rules behavior (Ydwen Efreet): attackers the
  target was sole blocker of become unblocked (CR 509.1h normally keeps them blocked).
- `Effects.OpponentGuessesTopCardKind(onGuessedRight, onGuessedWrong, chooser = Controller, guesser = Opponent)`
  (`OpponentGuessesTopCardKindEffect`) — "Choose land or nonland. An opponent guesses whether the top
  card of your library is the chosen kind. Reveal that card. If they guessed right, [onGuessedRight];
  otherwise, [onGuessedWrong]." (Gollum, Scheming Guide.) A reusable opponent-guess primitive that
  sequences two `ChooseOptionDecision`s: the `chooser` picks the framing land/nonland kind, then the
  `guesser` guesses the *actual* kind of the top card of the chooser's library; the card is revealed
  and the guess compared to reality (a correct guess = the guesser's call matches the actual top card).
  Both branch effects resolve in the source's original context, so `EffectTarget.Self` inside them
  refers to the ability's source. Empty library → no top card → guess can never be right, so the
  "wrong" branch runs. `chooser`/`guesser` reuse the shared `Chooser` enum (see `ChoosePileEffect`).
- `Effects.CanAttackDespiteDefenderThisTurn(target = Self)` (`CanAttackDespiteDefenderThisTurnEffect`) — target can attack this
  turn as though it didn't have defender. Adds a transient `CanAttackDespiteDefenderThisTurnComponent`
  honored by the defender attack-restriction rule and cleaned up at end of turn. The
  activated/temporary counterpart to the static `CanAttackDespiteDefender` ability (Krotiq Nestguard).
- `Effects.Goad(target = ContextTarget(0))` (`GoadEffect`) — goad target creature (CR 701.15).
  Tags the creature with `GoadedComponent(goaderIds: Set<EntityId>)`; the effect's controller at
  resolution is recorded as the goader. While goaded the creature (a) must attack each combat if able
  and (b) can't attack any player in `goaderIds` if a non-goader player is available to attack (per
  CR 701.15b the alternative is a *player*, not a planeswalker) — both checks
  live inline in `AttackPhaseManager.declareAttackers` alongside the must-attack-this-turn pass. The
  goader set deduplicates, so the same player re-goading is a no-op (CR 701.15d); multiple distinct
  goaders stack (CR 701.15c). After the untap step of each player's turn,
  `CleanupPhaseManager.expireGoadedDesignationFor` drops that player from every goader set and
  removes the component when the set is empty — same hook as the `Duration.UntilYourNextTurn`
  floating-effect path, implementing the "until your next turn" duration (CR 701.15a). Surfaced to
  the client as the `Goaded` badge on the
  card (listing goader names) — there is no separate game-log event. Used by **Glóin, Dwarf
  Emissary**: `Costs.Composite(Costs.Tap, Costs.Sacrifice(Artifact.withSubtype("Treasure"))):
  Goad(target creature)`.
- `Effects.SkipNextTurn(target = Controller, count = Fixed(1))` (`SkipNextTurnEffect`) — target skips their next `count` turns. `count` is a `DynamicAmount`, so it can read a pipeline value (e.g. a coin-flip tally via `DynamicAmount.VariableReference`). Skips accumulate on a `SkipNextTurnComponent(turns)`, decremented one turn per the player's turn-start; a resolved count of 0 is a no-op. Used by Lethal Vapors (one turn) and **Ral Zarek, Guest Lecturer** (skip N turns where N = heads).
- `Effects.FlipCoins(count, storeHeadsAs = "heads")` (`FlipCoinsEffect`) — flip `count` coins and store the number of heads under `storeHeadsAs` in the pipeline (`storedNumbers`) so a later sub-effect in the same composite can scale off it via `DynamicAmount.VariableReference`. The general "flip N coins, count heads" primitive (CR 705); unlike `FlipCoinEffect` (branch on win/lose) and `FlipTwoCoinsEffect` (branch on combined outcome) it only tallies. Each flip emits a `CoinFlipEvent`. **Ral Zarek, Guest Lecturer**'s ultimate composes `FlipCoins(5, "heads")` then `SkipNextTurn(target, count = VariableReference("heads"))`.
- `Effects.SkipNextDrawStep(target = Controller)` (`SkipNextDrawStepEffect`) — target skips their next draw step. Adds a one-shot `SkipDrawStepComponent` marker consumed by `DrawPhaseManager.performDrawStep` (Elfhame Sanctuary's "you skip your draw step this turn").
- `HijackNextTurnEffect(target)` — you control target's next turn.
- `GrantCantBeBlockedByChosenColorEffect(target, duration)` — unblockable except by chosen color.
- `Effects.GrantCantBeBlockedExceptBy(target, blockerFilter, duration = EndOfTurn)` (`GrantCantBeBlockedExceptByEffect`) —
  the floating, one-shot grant of "can't be blocked except by creatures matching `blockerFilter`". The dynamic
  counterpart to the static `CantBeBlockedExceptBy` ability (and the filter-based sibling of the color-only
  `GrantCantBeBlockedExceptByColorEffect`). Routes through the same projected `cantBeBlockedExceptByFilters` channel
  the static ability uses, so the existing `CantBeBlockedExceptByRule` enforces it. Used by **Resilient Roadrunner**:
  `{3}: This creature can't be blocked this turn except by creatures with haste` —
  `Effects.GrantCantBeBlockedExceptBy(EffectTarget.Self, GameObjectFilter.Creature.withKeyword(Keyword.HASTE))`.
- `CantBeBlockedByFewerThan(minBlockers, filter = source())` (static ability) — "can't be blocked
  except by N or more creatures," a generalization of menace (the N = 2 case). May be left unblocked;
  the restriction only applies once at least one creature blocks it. Enforced at block declaration in
  `BlockPhaseManager.validateMinBlockersRequirements`, mirroring the menace check. Used by Troll of
  Khazad-dûm (`CantBeBlockedByFewerThan(3)`).
- `CantCastSpellsEffect(target, until?)` — target can't cast spells. Facade: `Effects.CantCastSpells(target, duration)`.
- `CantPlayCardsFromHandEffect(target = Controller, duration = UntilYourNextTurn)` — target can't play cards (cast
  spells **or** play lands) from their **hand** zone for the duration. Hand-scoped: cards in exile/graveyard with a
  may-play permission stay playable. Facade: `Effects.CantPlayCardsFromHand(target, duration)`. Pairs with an impulse
  grant (`ExilePatterns.impulse`) so a player swaps their hand for the top cards of their library for a turn
  (Memory Vessel). Distinct from `CantCastSpells` (every zone, spells only).
- `Effects.CantPlayLandsThisTurn(target = Controller)` (`PreventLandPlaysThisTurnEffect`) — the target player can't
  play lands for the rest of this turn (sets remaining land drops to 0). Defaults to the controller (Rock Jockey);
  pass `EffectTarget.ContextTarget(n)` for "target player can't play lands this turn" cards like Turf Wound.
- `CantActivateLoyaltyAbilitiesEffect(target, duration)` — target can't activate planeswalkers' loyalty abilities.
  Facade: `Effects.CantActivateLoyaltyAbilities(target, duration)`. Sibling of `CantCastSpells`; compose the two for
  cards that forbid both (e.g. Revel in Silence).

### Forced sacrifice / discard

- `SacrificeTargetEffect(target, sacrificedByItsController = false)` — sacrifice a specific permanent. By
  default only fires if the resolving player controls it; set `sacrificedByItsController = true` for
  "[that creature]'s controller sacrifices it" (e.g. The Ring's Ring-bearer ability).
- `Effects.Sacrifice(filter, count, target)` / `ForceSacrificeEffect(target, count)` — edict; target
  sacrifices N permanents matching the filter (target chooses). `count` accepts an `Int` or a
  `DynamicAmount` — pass a `DynamicAmount` (via the `Effects.Sacrifice(filter, count: DynamicAmount, …)`
  overload / `ForceSacrificeEffect.dynamicCount`) for "sacrifices half the creatures they control,
  rounded up" (Rush of Dread): `Divide(AggregateBattlefield(Player.ContextPlayer(0), Creature), Fixed(2),
  roundUp = true)`. The amount is evaluated at resolution against the resolving context, so a per-target
  player reference counts the chosen player's permanents.
- `Effects.SacrificeAnyNumber(filter)` (= `SacrificeEffect(filter, any = true)`) — the *resolving*
  player chooses 0+ of their own permanents matching `filter` to sacrifice. Distinct from
  `ForceSacrifice` (edict on a target) and from `Costs.pay.Sacrifice` (a cost): this is a
  resolution effect. The sacrificed permanents are recorded in the effect context, so a later
  composite step can read the count via `DynamicAmounts.permanentsSacrificedThisWay()` — e.g.
  "Sacrifice any number of lands. Reveal the top X cards … where X is the number of lands
  sacrificed this way" (Hew the Entwood; same shape as Scapeshift).
- "Return a permanent you control [to its owner's hand]" is a pipeline composition, not an effect type:
  `GatherCards(BattlefieldMatching(filter, Player.You, excludeSelf?))` →
  `SelectFromCollection(ChooseExactly(1), useTargetingUI = true)` → `MoveCollection(→ HAND)` (the
  battlefield→hand move routes each card to its owner's hand). See Mistbreath Elder.

### Stack manipulation

- `CounterEffect(target, condition?, destination?)` — counter a spell/ability; optionally send elsewhere.
  - `target = CounterTarget.Spell` / `Ability` / `SpellOrAbility` — `SpellOrAbility` dispatches at resolution by inspecting whether the stack entity has a `SpellOnStackComponent`. Used by Teferi's Response.
  - `condition = CounterCondition.UnlessPaysMana(cost, onPaid?)` / `UnlessPaysDynamic(amount, onPaid?)` — "unless its controller pays …" with an optional `onPaid: Effect` rider that fires **only** when the spell's controller pays (Divert Disaster's "If they do, you create a Lander token"). The rider executes with the counter's controller as `controllerId`, so "you" in the rider resolves to the caster of the counter. The rider does not fire when the spell is countered. Facade: `Effects.CounterUnlessPays(cost, onPaid)` / `Effects.CounterUnlessDynamicPays(amount, exileOnCounter, onPaid)`.
- `CounterAllOnStackEffect(filter?, destination?)` — counter everything matching.
- `ExileTargetSpellEffect(makePlotted = false)` (facade `Effects.ExileTargetSpell(makePlotted)`) — exile target spell (CR 718 "exile target spell"). **Not a counter:** it removes the spell from the stack and exiles the card even if the spell *can't be countered* (so it works where `CounterEffect(destination = Exile())` no-ops), and it fires no "whenever a spell is countered" trigger — but the spell still fails to resolve because it left the stack. With `makePlotted = true` the exiled card becomes *plotted* for its **owner** (gains `PlottedComponent` + a permanent free-cast-on-a-later-turn `MayPlayPermission` gated by `SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`, granted to the owner per CR 718.2), emitting a `CardPlottedEvent`. Pair with `Targets.Spell`. Used by **Aven Interrupter** ("When this creature enters, exile target spell. It becomes plotted.").
- `MarkSpellExileWithCountersEffect(target = TriggeringEntity, counterType, count = 1)` (facade `Effects.MarkSpellExileWithCounters(target, counterType, count)`) — mark a spell on the stack so that, **as it resolves**, it is exiled with `count` counters of `counterType` on it instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Lets the spell resolve fully, then re-routes only its post-resolution destination via `ExileAfterResolveComponent(onlyIfResolved = true)` — so if the spell is countered or fizzles it goes to the graveyard normally. Used by **Goliath Daydreamer** ("exile that card with a dream counter on it instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves").
- `MarkSpellPlotOnResolveEffect(target = TriggeringEntity)` (facade `Effects.MarkSpellPlotOnResolve(target)`) — the plot sibling of `MarkSpellExileWithCounters`: as the spell resolves it is exiled instead of going to the graveyard and **becomes plotted** for its owner (`PlottedComponent` + permanent free-cast-on-a-later-turn `MayPlayPermission` gated by `SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`, emitting `CardPlottedEvent`). Also `onlyIfResolved` — a countered/fizzled spell is not exiled and doesn't become plotted. Distinct from `ExileTargetSpell(makePlotted = true)`, which removes a *targeted* spell from the stack now (it never resolves); this one only changes a self-cast spell's destination after it resolves. Used by **Lilah, Undefeated Slickshot** ("Whenever you cast a multicolored instant or sorcery spell from your hand, exile that spell instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves. If you do, it becomes plotted.").
- `OpenLifeBid(onWin, participant = Player.AnOpponent)` — open life-bidding auction between you and `participant` (resolved against the effect context). You open at a bid of 1; the two bidders alternate topping the high bid (yes/no to top, then a number for the amount, capped at the bidder's life) until one passes. The high bidder loses that much life; `onWin` runs **only if you win**, with the original targets in context. If `participant` resolves to you (or to nobody), you're the sole bidder and win at the opening bid. For Mages' Contest, bid against the targeted spell's controller and counter it: `Effects.OpenLifeBid(Effects.CounterSpell(), Player.ControllerOf("target spell"))` — pair with a `TargetSpell` requirement.
- `DestroySourceOfTargetedAbilityEffect` — when the targeted stack object is a permanent's activated/triggered ability, destroy that source permanent. Compose *before* the counter step so the ability component is still readable (Teferi's Response).
- `CopyTargetSpellEffect(target, keywordsForCopy, removeLegendary, addedTokenKeywords, sacrificeTokenAtStep, sacrificeTokenOnlyOnControllersTurn)` (facade `Effects.CopyTargetSpell(...)`) — copy a spell on the stack. `keywordsForCopy` grants keywords to the copy **while it remains a spell** (wither/lifelink). When the copied spell is a **permanent spell** it becomes a token as it resolves (CR 707.10f); the *token-side* riders bake onto that token for its life on the battlefield: `addedTokenKeywords` (e.g. `HASTE`) are unioned into the token's base keywords, and `sacrificeTokenAtStep: Step?` registers a delayed "sacrifice this token" trigger at the next matching step (`sacrificeTokenOnlyOnControllersTurn` gates it to "your next" step). The spell-copy mirror of `CreateTokenCopyOfTargetEffect.addedKeywords` / `sacrificeAtStep`. Used by **Choreographed Sparks** ("Copy target creature spell you control. The copy gains haste and 'At the beginning of the end step, sacrifice this token.'"). Pair with `Targets.CreatureSpellYouControl`.
- `CopyEachTargetSpellEffect()` (facade `Effects.CopyEachTargetSpell(keywordsForCopy, removeLegendary)`) — copy **every** spell targeted by this effect (one copy per `ChosenTarget.Spell` in context), pausing per copy that has targets so the controller may choose new targets (CR 707.10). Pair with an unlimited spell target requirement — `Targets.AnyNumberOfInstantOrSorcerySpells`. Used by Display of Power ("Copy any number of target instant and/or sorcery spells."). Spells flagged `cantBeCopied` are skipped.
- `CopyTargetTriggeredAbilityEffect(target)` — copy a triggered ability on the stack.
- `CopyTargetSpellOrAbilityEffect(target)` (facade `Effects.CopyTargetSpellOrAbility(target)`) — copy whichever kind of stack object the single target resolved to, dispatching at resolution by inspecting the stack entity's component: an instant/sorcery **spell** copies via the spell-copy path, a **triggered ability** via `CopyTargetTriggeredAbilityEffect`'s logic, an **activated ability** by cloning its `ActivatedAbilityOnStackComponent`. You may choose new targets for the copy (CR 707.10c). Pair with `Targets.InstantSorcerySpellOrAbility` (one requirement admitting all four kinds). Generalizes the two single-kind copy effects into the "copy target instant/sorcery spell, activated ability, or triggered ability" clause — **Return the Favor**.
- `CopyNextSpellCastEffect(copies = 1, spellFilter = InstantOrSorcery)` (facade `Effects.CopyNextSpellCast(copies, spellFilter)`) — when its controller next casts a spell matching `spellFilter` this turn, create `copies` copies of it. `spellFilter` is a `GameObjectFilter` matched against the spell as it's cast, so the default "instant or sorcery" (Howl of the Horde) can be widened — e.g. `GameObjectFilter.Creature` for "copy the next creature spell." Consumed after one matching cast. Non-matching casts leave the entry waiting.
- `CopyEachSpellCastEffect(copies = 1, spellFilter = InstantOrSorcery)` (facade `Effects.CopyEachSpellCast(copies, spellFilter)`) — the persistent sibling: copies **every** spell matching `spellFilter` the controller casts for the rest of the turn (The Mirari Conjecture Ch. III). Same `spellFilter` parameterization as above.
- `MakeNextSpellUncounterableEffect(spellFilter = Any)` (facade `Effects.MakeNextSpellUncounterable(spellFilter)`) — one-shot rider: the controller's **next** spell matching `spellFilter` cast this turn can't be countered, then the entry is consumed. Stamps `CantBeCounteredComponent` on that spell as it's cast (so it stays uncounterable for as long as it's on the stack); non-matching casts leave the entry waiting, and an unused entry clears at the start of the controller's next turn. Same pending-rider shape as `CopyNextSpellCastEffect`. Contrast with the duration-based `GrantSpellsCantBeCountered` (Domri), which protects **every** matching spell cast for a whole duration rather than just the next one. Used by **Mistrise Village** ("{U}, {T}: The next spell you cast this turn can't be countered.").
- `CopyCardIntoCollectionEffect(source, storeAs)` (facade `Effects.CopyCardIntoCollection(source, storeAs)`) — copy a **card in a zone** (not a spell on the stack), publishing the copy's entity id to pipeline collection `storeAs`. Per Rule 707.12 the copy is created in the card's current zone under the effect's controller and tagged as a stack-style copy, so once cast it becomes a token if it's a permanent spell and ceases to exist if it's an instant/sorcery (Rule 707.10). Pair with `CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect(from)` (facade `Effects.CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCost(from)`, wrap in `MayEffect` for "you may cast") to express "copy a card, then cast the copy" — e.g. **Shiko, Paragon of the Way**: `Composite(MoveToZoneEffect(target, Zone.EXILE), Effects.CopyCardIntoCollection(target, "copy"), MayEffect(Effects.CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCost("copy")))`. A copy that is never cast is swept up by the Rule 707.10a state-based action (`PhantomCardCopiesCheck`), so no explicit cleanup step is needed. For the "you may cast it" wording that **doesn't** say "without paying its mana cost", use `Effects.CastFromCollection(from, storeCastTo?)` (`CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect(from, payManaCost = true, storeCastTo)`): the controller pays the spell's normal cost (an {X} spell prompts for X) instead of casting for free. Pass `storeCastTo` to publish the cast card's id to that pipeline collection on a successful cast, then gate a follow-up with `IfYouDoEffect(this, then, SuccessCriterion.CollectionNonEmpty(storeCastTo))` — e.g. **Kaervek, the Punisher**: `Composite(Move(target, EXILE), CopyCardIntoCollection(target, "copy"), MayEffect(IfYouDoEffect(CastFromCollection("copy", storeCastTo = "cast"), LoseLife(2, Controller), SuccessCriterion.CollectionNonEmpty("cast"))))` — declining (or being unable to pay) leaves the collection empty, so no life is lost. (`storeCastTo` is reliably published for synchronous casts and target-selection casts; an {X}-cost spell cast with no targets is the one sub-case where the publish doesn't survive the X pause.) **Free-casting still pays the copied spell's non-mana additional costs** (CR 601.2f / 118.9 waive only the mana cost) — when the copy carries a printed sacrifice / discard / exile / tap additional cost, the engine resolves it during the synthesized cast: a forced single option is auto-paid, and a real choice pauses for an on-battlefield (sacrifice/tap) or overlay (discard/exile) selection; if the cost can't be paid the cast doesn't happen (e.g. Roving Actuator copying **Embrace Oblivion**'s "sacrifice an artifact or creature" still makes you sacrifice).
- `CastAnyNumberFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect(from)` (facade `Effects.CastAnyNumberFromCollectionWithoutPayingCost(from)`) — the multi-cast sibling of `CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect`. **During this effect's resolution**, the controller is offered the cards in pipeline collection `from` (filtered to those still in exile) one at a time and may cast each for free until they decline; each cast's targets / X / modes flow through the normal cast machinery. Because the casts go through the synthesized-cast path (like Cascade), card-type **timing restrictions are ignored** and no lingering "you may play it later" permission is granted — cards left uncast just stay where they are (the controller can't wait until later in the turn). Hand it the eligible set: filter the collection upstream (e.g. nonland + `FilterCollection(ManaValueAtMost(...))`). Models "you may cast any number of spells with mana value X or less from among them without paying their mana costs" — e.g. **Kotis, the Fangkeeper**: `GatherCards(TopOfLibrary(damage, TriggeringPlayer)) → MoveCollection(→ exile) → FilterCollection(Nonland) → FilterCollection(ManaValueAtMost(damage)) → CastAnyNumberFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect("castable")`. Also used by **Villainous Wealth** (the same chain off an {X} sorcery) and **Etali, Primal Storm** (exile the top card of each library, no MV cap).
- `FilterCollection(from, CollectionFilter.InZone(zone), storeMatching)` — keep only the cards in pipeline collection `from` that are **currently** in `zone`. Pipeline collections track entity refs, not live location, so a card can leave its zone mid-resolution (e.g. an exiled card cast for free moves to the stack). Use this to act on "the ones still there." Models the "you may cast it … if you don't, put that card into your hand" fallback of the **Tarkir: Dragonstorm "…storm" enchantments** (Breaching Dragonstorm): `GatherUntilMatch(Nonland) → MoveCollection(→ exile) → FilterCollection(ManaValueAtMost(8), "castable") → ConditionalOnCollection("castable", ifNotEmpty = MayEffect(CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCost("castable"))) → FilterCollection("nonland", InZone(EXILE), "uncast") → MoveCollection("uncast" → hand)` — only the nonland still in exile (not the one just cast) goes to hand; the lands stay exiled. The `ConditionalOnCollection` wrapper suppresses the empty "you may cast" prompt when the nonland's mana value is > 8.
- `MoveCollectionEffect(from, destination, filter = null, …)` — move a pipeline collection to a zone.
  `destination = ToZone(zone, player, placement)`; `ZonePlacement.Tapped` enters the battlefield
  tapped, and `player` sets the controller for a battlefield destination (so a card can enter under
  your control even when owned by an opponent — Sméagol). The optional `filter` moves only the cards
  in `from` matching it (the rest stay), letting one revealed pile be split by type in successive
  steps — e.g. revealed lands → battlefield tapped, the rest → graveyard/library (Sméagol, Galadriel
  of Lothlórien, The Ring Goes South). (Equivalent to a `FilterCollection` partition; the inline
  filter just avoids naming an intermediate collection.)
- `ChangeTargetEffect(spell, newTarget)` — change a spell's target.
- `ChangeSpellTargetEffect(spell, filter)` — same, filtered.
- `ReselectTargetRandomlyEffect(spell)` — re-choose targets at random.
- `Effects.ChangeTriggeringObjectTargets(chooser = RetargetChooser.Controller)` — the player named by `chooser` may change the target or targets of the triggering spell/ability (`context.triggeringEntityId`); the player-chosen, multi-target counterpart of `ReselectTargetRandomly`. `RetargetChooser.Controller` = the effect's controller; `RetargetChooser.OwnerOfStored(name)` = the owner of the single card in pipeline collection `name` (≠1 card → no chooser → no-op). Reselection is offered slot-by-slot among the original object's legal targets (legality judged from *its* controller, current target kept as a "keep" option, no target chosen twice). **Psychic Battle** composes from atoms: `Composite(GatherCards(TopOfLibrary(1, Player.Each), revealed=true, storeAs="revealed"), FilterCollection("revealed", GreatestManaValue, storeMatching="w"), ChangeTriggeringObjectTargets(RetargetChooser.OwnerOfStored("w")))` — a tie keeps several greatest cards so `OwnerOfStored` finds no unique owner and the targets stay put.
- `ReturnSpellToOwnersHandEffect` / `Effects.ReturnSpellToOwnersHand()` — return the targeted spell (`ContextTarget`) from the stack to its owner's hand. Not a counter (CR 701.27 / 701.5b), so "can't be countered" doesn't block it. Pair with `Targets.Spell` (Reprieve, Hullbreaker Horror).
- `Effects.ReturnSpellOrPermanentToOwnersHand(target = ContextTarget(0))` (`ReturnSpellOrPermanentToOwnersHandEffect`) — bounce one target to its owner's hand, dispatching on what it resolves to: a **spell on the stack** is removed from the stack to hand (does not resolve; not a counter), a **permanent** is bounced normally (delegates to the standard `MoveToZone(HAND)` path with its full leave-the-battlefield cleanup). The bounce counterpart of `PutOnLibraryPositionOfChoiceEffect`. Pair with `TargetSpellOrPermanent` for "return target spell or nonland permanent…" cards (Press the Enemy). To cap a follow-up free-cast at the bounced object's mana value, capture it first with `Effects.StoreNumber("mv", DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(EntityReference.Target(0), EntityNumericProperty.ManaValue))` before bouncing, then read it via `DynamicAmount.VariableReference("mv")`.

### Combat-shape & misc

- `PreventDamageEffect(amount, direction, scope, sourceFilter, onPrevented, gainLifeFromColors, duration)` — prevention shield. `amount = null` prevents all. `sourceFilter` can be `ChosenSource` (player picks any source on resolution) or `ChosenColoredSource` (player picks a source on resolution, but only colored sources are offered — "a source of your choice that shares a color with the mana spent"; a colorless source qualifies for nothing, so it's never offered — Protective Sphere). `onPrevented: Effect?` is an **arbitrary follow-up effect** run when a single-instance `ChosenSource` shield prevents an instance of damage (see below). `gainLifeFromColors: Set<Color>` makes the shield's controller gain that much life whenever it prevents damage from a source of one of those colors (Samite Ministration). Facades: `Effects.PreventNextDamage`, `Effects.PreventNextDamageFromChosenSource(amount, target)`, `Effects.PreventNextDamageFromChosenSource(onPrevented)`, `Effects.PreventAllDamageFromChosenSource(target, gainLifeFromColors)`, `Effects.PreventAllDamageFromChosenColoredSource(target)`, `Effects.DeflectNextDamageFromChosenSource()`, `Effects.ReflectNextDamageFromChosenSourceToController()`. The `preventDamage` flag (default true) — when **false**, the chosen-source shield does NOT prevent the damage (it still hits in full) but still fires its `onPrevented` reaction with the captured amount; this is the "instead it still deals that damage to you AND deals that much to its controller" shape (Eye for an Eye), as opposed to the deflect/prevent shape (Deflecting Palm).
  - **Prevent-and-react (`onPrevented`)** — instead of a bespoke reaction type, the chosen-source shield runs **any composed effect** when it fires, as a real triggered ability on the stack ("When damage is prevented this way, …", CR-faithful — opponents get priority and can respond). Mechanically: on resolution the shield is created **and** a linked event-based delayed triggered ability (`CreateDelayedTriggerEffect`-style) whose `effect` is `onPrevented`; when the shield prevents an instance it emits an internal `DamagePreventedEvent` that fires only that delayed trigger (matched by id). Inside the trigger the prevented amount is `DynamicAmounts.preventedDamage()` ("that much"/"that many") and the prevented source's controller is `EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity` ("that source's controller") — the same pair Tephraderm uses. So Deflecting Palm's `onPrevented` = `DealDamage(ControllerOfTriggeringEntity, preventedDamage())`; New Way Forward's = `Composite(DealDamage(ControllerOfTriggeringEntity, preventedDamage()), DrawCards(preventedDamage()))`. Because the payoff is a normal stack ability, it may be interactive (targets, replacements) like any other.
- `Effects.BecomeCreature(target, power, toughness, keywords, creatureTypes, removeTypes, colors, duration)`
  (`BecomeCreatureEffect`) — animate / "becomes a creature." Adds CREATURE (Layer 4), *sets* creature
  subtypes to `creatureTypes` (replacing all others), removes `removeTypes`, *sets* `colors` (Layer 5,
  replacing all others; `null` = keep), grants `keywords` (Layer 6), and sets base P/T (Layer 7b set
  values). **`power`/`toughness` are `DynamicAmount`** (evaluated once at resolution, CR 613.4c, then
  stamped as a fixed set-P/T floating effect); an `Int` convenience overload wraps them in
  `DynamicAmount.Fixed`. Sarkhan's "4/4 Dragon" (fixed); Fractalize's "green and blue Fractal with
  base power and toughness each equal to X plus 1, losing all other colors and creature types"
  (`power = toughness = Add(XValue, Fixed(1))`, `creatureTypes = {"Fractal"}`, `colors = {GREEN, BLUE}`).
- `BecomeArtifactEffect(target, cardTypes = {"ARTIFACT"}, subtypes, colors = emptySet(), loseAllAbilities = true, grantedAbility?, duration = Permanent)` — the general "becomes a Treasure/Food/Clue/artifact" transform: stacks continuous floating effects on `target` — Layer 4 `SetCardTypes` (replaces *all* card types) + `SetAllSubtypes` (replaces *all* subtypes), Layer 5 color (`emptySet()` = colorless), Layer 6 `RemoveAllAbilities` when `loseAllAbilities` — plus an optional single `grantedAbility` recorded durably in `grantedActivatedAbilities` (so it survives the ability wipe; the enumerators read it after the projected `lostAllAbilities` check). `Duration.Permanent` ends only when the permanent leaves the battlefield. Differs from `BecomeCreatureEffect` (which *adds* CREATURE + sets P/T): this fully replaces types/subtypes so the result is exactly the named artifact. (Vraska, the Silencer: a dead opponent's creature returns as a bare colorless Treasure with the sac-for-mana ability.)
- `BecomeSaddledEffect(target = Self)` (facade `Effects.BecomeSaddled()`) — target permanent becomes saddled until end of turn (CR 702.171b). The resolving half of a Saddle ability: stamps the transient `SaddledComponent` marker (cleared at end of turn / on leaving the battlefield; not copiable) and emits `BecameSaddledEvent`. No P/T or type change — read the marker with `Conditions.SourceIsSaddled` / `.saddled()`.
- `BecomePreparedEffect(target = Self)` (facade `Effects.BecomePrepared()`) — target permanent becomes prepared (Secrets of Strixhaven). The target must be a `CardLayout.PREPARE` permanent on the battlefield; becoming prepared creates a castable copy of its prepare spell in exile (shared `PreparationLogic.makePrepared`, the same path used when a `Keyword.PREPARED` creature enters prepared). A creature already prepared, not on the battlefield, or not a preparation card does nothing. Used by Leech Collector ("Whenever you gain life for the first time each turn, this creature becomes prepared").
- `UnprepareEffect(target = Self)` (facade `Effects.Unprepare()`) — target permanent **becomes unprepared** (Secrets of Strixhaven), the inverse of `BecomePrepared`. Strips the target's `PreparedComponent` and removes the cast-from-exile permission for its exile prepare-spell copy; the now-orphaned copy is swept by the `PhantomCardCopiesCheck` state-based action (which removes prepare-spell copies whose source is no longer prepared). No-op if the target isn't prepared. Used by Biblioplex Tomekeeper ("Target creature becomes unprepared").
- `EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTargetEffect(target, filter, duration, excludeTarget, affected)` — mass copy (Mirrorform, Naga Fleshcrafter renew). Facade `Effects.EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTarget(...)`. Copies copiable values only (Rule 707) — counters, tapped state, attached auras/equipment and non-copy modifiers stay put. `duration = Duration.Permanent` (default) bakes the copy into base state for good; `Duration.EndOfTurn` makes a temporary copy reverted by the end-of-turn cleanup (each affected permanent restores its pre-copy `CardComponent` from its `CopyOfComponent` snapshot). `excludeTarget = true` keeps the copy **source** out of the affected set, for "each **other** … becomes a copy of that …" wordings where the target keeps its own identity (and any counter just placed on it). `affected` (an `EffectTarget`, e.g. a second `ContextTarget`) switches to the single-permanent "target permanent A becomes a copy of target permanent B" shape (Fleeting Reflection: "target creature you control … becomes a copy of up to one **other** target creature") — only that one resolved permanent becomes a copy of `target`, and `filter`/`excludeTarget` are ignored; if `affected` resolves to nothing (optional target omitted) the effect is a no-op.
- `BecomeCopyOfLinkedExileEffect(affected = AttachedToTriggeringPermanent)` — facade `Effects.BecomeCopyOfLinkedExile(affected)`. The `affected` permanent becomes a copy of the first creature card in the effect's **source's linked exile** (`LinkedExileComponent` — the card the source banished via `Effects.ExileUntilLeaves`), copiable values only (Rule 707.2). Baked into the affected permanent's `CardComponent` like Clone, but tagged with a `CopyWhileAttachedComponent(sourceId)`; the `AttachedCopyExpiryCheck` state-based action reverts the copy (restoring the pre-copy snapshot) the moment the source stops being attached to it — detach, re-attach elsewhere, or source leaving (CR 611.2b, one-way). No-op when the source's linked exile holds no creature card. Used by Assimilation Aegis ("for as long as this Equipment remains attached to it, that creature becomes a copy of a creature card exiled with this Equipment").
- `AnimateLandEffect(target, subtypes, keywords, duration)` — land becomes a creature.
- `ExploreEffect(target)` — Explore mechanic (reveal top; land → battlefield, else hand + counter).
- `MakePreparedEffect(target = Self)` — facade `Effects.MakePrepared(target)`. The target permanent **becomes prepared** (Prepare — Secrets of Strixhaven): gains the prepared status and gets a castable copy of its card's prepare spell (`cardFaces[0]`) in its controller's exile (same machinery as entering prepared, shared via `PreparedService.makePrepared`). No-op if already prepared, or the card has no prepare face. Use for cards that *become* prepared mid-game (e.g. Joined Researchers' end-step trigger); cards that "enter prepared" use `Keyword.PREPARED` on a `PREPARE`-layout card instead.
- `AttachEquipmentEffect(equip, target)` — attach an Equipment.
- `TapUntapEffect(target, isTap)` — tap or untap. Facade: `Effects.Tap` / `Effects.Untap`.
- `Effects.TapEachTarget()` — "tap up to N target creatures": taps every object chosen as a target.
  Composes `ForEachTargetEffect` over `Effects.Tap(ContextTarget(0))`, so the count lives only on the
  spell's `TargetCreature`/`TargetPermanent` (`count`, `unlimited`, or `dynamicMaxCount`) — never
  duplicated on the effect. For "tap X target creatures" use `dynamicMaxCount = DynamicAmount.XValue`
  on the target (Icy Blast); for a fixed cap use `count = N` (Tidal Surge, Choking Tethers, Eddymurk
  Crab). Do **not** pass a magic `count = 20` to mean "any number" — use `unlimited`/`dynamicMaxCount`.
- `Effects.UntapEachTarget()` — the untap twin of `TapEachTarget`: untaps every object chosen as a
  target ("untap each of those creatures"). Composes `ForEachTargetEffect` over
  `Effects.Untap(ContextTarget(0))`, with the count owned by the spell's target requirement.
- `PhaseOutEffect(target = Self)` — phase the target permanent out (Rule 702.26); facade `Effects.PhaseOut(target)`. While phased out it's treated as though it doesn't exist (excluded from `getBattlefield`, so from projection, triggers, combat, targeting, and SBAs) and phases back in before its controller's next untap step. Indirect phasing (attached Auras/Equipment) is handled automatically. Used as the `suffer` branch of a pay-or-phase trigger (Vaporous Djinn: "phases out unless you pay {U}{U}" = `PayOrSufferEffect(Costs.pay.Mana(...), Effects.PhaseOut())`), or as the reaction of a "becomes the target of a spell, it phases out" trigger (King of the Oathbreakers = `Triggers.BecomesTargetOfSpell(...)` + `Effects.PhaseOut(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity)`). The matching phase-in moment is the `Triggers.PhasesIn(filter?)` trigger (see Triggers below).
- `PhaseOutUntilLeavesEffect(target, tapOnPhaseIn)` / `Effects.PhaseOutUntilLeaves(target, tapOnPhaseIn)` — phase the target out **indefinitely, linked to the effect's source** (the phasing analogue of `ExileUntilLeaves`): it skips its untap-step phase-in and stays out until the source leaves the battlefield. Pair with `Effects.PhaseInLinkedToSource()` on the source's `LeavesBattlefield` trigger, which phases everything the source phased out this way back in (tapping those flagged `tapOnPhaseIn`). The link lives on the phased-out permanent (`PhasedOutComponent.phaseInOnSourceLeaves`); indirect phasing carries Auras/Equipment out with the creature. This is Oubliette (ETB phase-out + leaves-trigger phase-in, tapped).
- `MarkExileOnDeathEffect(target)` — replace next "to graveyard" with "to exile".
- `Effects.AddAdditionalUpkeepSteps(amount)` (`amount: DynamicAmount` or `Int`) — give the
  controller `amount` additional upkeep steps after the current phase (Obeka, Splitter of Seconds:
  "you get that many additional upkeep steps after this phase"). Per CR 500.10, each added upkeep
  step creates the *beginning phase* that normally contains it, with the untap and draw steps
  skipped; per CR 500.8 the phases are inserted after the current phase, and after any additional
  combat phases added to the same point (most-recently-created phase first). "At the beginning of
  [your] upkeep" abilities trigger in each inserted step (CR 503.1a). Steps are always added to the
  controller's own turn (CR 500.10a). Implemented by accumulating an `AdditionalUpkeepStepsComponent`
  count on the active player, drained by `TurnManager.advanceStep` after the postcombat main phase
  (after the additional-combat-phase check), each remaining count redirecting into a fresh upkeep
  step in the beginning phase. Read "that many" from the triggering combat damage with
  `DynamicAmount.ContextProperty(ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT)`.
- `GatedEffect(gate, then, otherwise?, decisionMaker?)` — **the unified resolution frame for the
  optional / gated-effect cluster** (phase-rs Lesson 1). A `Gate` decides whether `then` runs; if it
  fails, `otherwise` runs. One executor + one continuation/resumer own the canonical unwind order, so
  targets on `then`/`otherwise` lock at trigger time (CR 603.3d) and the gate is resolved at
  resolution time (CR 117.3a) by `decisionMaker` (defaults to the controller) — the may-vs-target
  timing is correct by construction rather than re-encoded per wrapper. Gates:
  - `Gate.MayDecide(prompt?, hint?, sourceRequiredZone?, inlineOnTrigger?, feasibility?)` — pure yes/no
    ("You may [then]."). Replaces `MayEffect` (see the `MayEffect` facade below). `sourceRequiredZone`
    skips the gate silently when the source has left that zone by resolution; `inlineOnTrigger`
    renders the yes/no on the triggering permanent rather than as a modal. `feasibility` (a
    `FeasibilityCheck`) — when set and **unmet** at resolution, the may-action is impossible, so the
    player "doesn't": the prompt is skipped and `otherwise` runs directly. Lets "you may sacrifice an
    artifact. If you don't, …" apply its else automatically when the controller has no artifact (the
    no-target analogue of a targeted "may" with no legal targets falling to its else branch).
  - `Gate.MayPay(cost)` — "You may [cost]. If you do, [then]." `cost` is a cost **effect**
    (`PayManaCostEffect`, `PayDynamicManaCostEffect`, `PayLifeEffect`, `SacrificeEffect`, or a
    `CompositeEffect` of them). An unaffordable cost (fixed mana, dynamic mana, and life are
    recognized — the dynamic-mana amount is checked against its own `payer`; other shapes are
    assumed payable) skips the prompt straight to `otherwise`. On "yes", the cost is paid then `then`
    runs (`stopOnError`: an unpayable cost aborts the payoff). For a recognized mana cost the "yes"
    button is labeled with the concrete amount — a dynamic cost shows its computed total ("Pay {8}"),
    not the formula. When the cost is a
    `PayDynamicManaCostEffect` with a non-default `payer` (e.g. the "each player's upkeep, that player
    may pay …" shape — Magnetic Mountain), set `decisionMaker` to that same player so the one who is
    charged is the one prompted; affordability is already gauged against the `payer` regardless.
  - `Gate.WhenCondition(condition)` — **not a decision, a state test.** Succeeds iff `condition`
    holds at resolution; no prompt, no pause — `then`/`otherwise` run synchronously in the executor.
    The condition evaluates through the shared `ConditionEvaluationContext` (identical at resolution
    and projection). Replaces `ConditionalEffect` (see "Sequencing & conditional" below).
  - `Gate.DoAction(action, successCriterion?)` — **not a decision, an *action-outcome* test.**
    `action` is performed (it may itself pause for sub-decisions); once it has fully drained,
    `successCriterion` scores it against a pre-action snapshot to decide whether it "happened" —
    success → `then`, failure → `otherwise`. This is "[action]. If you do, [then]" (a declined or
    no-op action runs `otherwise`, not `then`), distinct from `MayDecide` (gates on the yes/no) and
    `MayPay` (gates on paying a cost). `successCriterion` defaults to `SuccessCriterion.Auto`, which
    infers success from the action's terminal zone-move (a pipeline `MoveCollection` to a zone, or a
    single `MoveToZone` of the source itself) growing its destination zone. **Auto is only legal on
    shapes it can infer** (`SuccessCriterion.Auto.canInfer`): card-load validation (`CardValidator`,
    enforced corpus-wide by `SuccessCriterionValidationTest`) rejects an Auto criterion on any other
    action — non-zone-move actions (deal damage, gain life, …) must state `SuccessCriterion.Always`
    or `CollectionNonEmpty(name, min)` explicitly instead of silently inheriting a fail-open
    "it happened". `CollectionNonEmpty` gates on the action's actual pipeline collection
    (`storedCollections[name].size >= min` after the action runs) — the collections propagate onto
    the gate frame via `exposeCollectionsToNextFrame`, in both the synchronous and the
    paused/continuation-drain paths. The executor pre-pushes a `GatedActionContinuation` so a paused
    action auto-resumes and evaluates after its own continuations drain. Replaces `IfYouDoEffect`
    (see "Sequencing & conditional" below).
  - `Gate.MayPayX` — **not a yes/no, a number chooser.** "You may pay {X}. If you do, [then]." The
    decision-maker is prompted for a number 0..(most generic mana they can produce); paying X > 0
    succeeds → `then` runs with the chosen X bound into the context (read via `DynamicAmount.XValue`),
    X = 0 declines → `otherwise`. An unaffordable gate (no mana) is skipped silently. A parameterless
    `data object` (the {X} cost is implicit). The executor builds a `ChooseNumberDecision` and reuses
    the existing `MayPayXContinuation`/`resumeMayPayX` to auto-tap and bind X. Replaces
    `MayPayXForEffect` (see "Optional & gated" below).
  - The multi-player APNAP `AnyPlayerMayPayEffect` stays a **standalone effect**, not a gate — a
    single `decisionMaker` can't express its turn-order loop (see below).
- `MayEffect(effect, descriptionOverride?, sourceRequiredZone?, inlineOnTrigger?, hint?, decisionMaker?, otherwise?)`
  — "You may [effect]." Facade preserved for existing cards; it now **lowers to
  `GatedEffect(Gate.MayDecide(...), then = effect, otherwise = otherwise, decisionMaker = decisionMaker)`**
  (compiled form is `Gated`, no distinct `May` type or executor). The may-vs-target trigger reorder —
  for a "may" ability that *also* targets, the yes/no is asked *before* target selection (Invigorating
  Boon) — recognizes the lowered shape via the `Effect.asMayDecide()` matcher (a bare `Gate.MayDecide`
  with no `otherwise`).
  - **`decisionMaker` routes the yes/no to a non-controller** — pass any player `EffectTarget`
    (`EffectTarget.TargetController` for "that creature's controller may …", or a bound target such
    as `target("target opponent", Targets.Opponent)` for "**target opponent may …**"). Only the
    yes/no prompt is delegated; the `then`/`otherwise` effects still resolve from the controller's
    perspective unless they themselves target a specific player.
  - **`otherwise` is the "if that player doesn't" branch** — runs iff the chooser declines. Combine
    with a delegated `decisionMaker` for "target opponent may [then]; if that player doesn't,
    [otherwise]" (Palantír of Orthanc: "target opponent may have you draw a card; if that player
    doesn't, you mill X cards and that player loses life equal to their total mana value").
- `OptionalCostEffect(cost, ifPaid, ifNotPaid?)` — "You may [cost]. If you do, [ifPaid]." Facade
  preserved for existing cards; it now **lowers to `GatedEffect` with a `Gate.MayPay`** gate (compiled
  form is `Gated`, not a distinct `OptionalCost` type).
- `MayPayManaEffect(cost, effect)` — "You may pay [cost]. If you do, [effect]." Facade preserved for
  existing cards; it now **lowers to `GatedEffect(Gate.MayPay(PayManaCostEffect(cost)), then = effect)`**
  (compiled form is `Gated`, no distinct `MayPayMana` type or executor). The engine recognizes this
  exact shape — a flat mana `Gate.MayPay` with no `otherwise` and the default decision-maker, whether
  authored via `MayPayManaEffect` or `OptionalCostEffect(PayManaCostEffect(...), …)` — and gives it the
  bespoke optional-mana-payment UX rather than the generic gated yes/no: **manual mana-source
  selection** at resolution (a `SelectManaSourcesDecision`, so sources that sacrifice or carry a tap
  sub-cost aren't auto-tapped), and, for a **triggered ability that also requires a target** (the
  Onslaught "Words of …" cycle, Lightning Rift), the deliberate **pay → select-mana → choose-target**
  order so the player isn't asked to pick a target before deciding to pay. Composite-cost, life-gated,
  or `otherwise`-bearing MayPay gates keep the generic auto-tapping path.
- `MayPayXForEffect(effect)` — "You may pay {X}. If you do, [effect]." Facade preserved for existing
  cards; it now **lowers to `GatedEffect(Gate.MayPayX, then = effect)`** (compiled form is `Gated`, no
  distinct `MayPayX` type or executor). Prompts a 0..max-affordable number chooser; paying X auto-taps
  X generic mana and binds the chosen X into `effect`'s context (read via `DynamicAmount.XValue`).
  Decree of Justice's cycling trigger, Hollow Specter's combat-damage trigger.
- `Effects.AnyPlayerMayPay(cost, consequence)` / `Effects.UnlessAnyPlayerPays(cost, effect)` —
  back the single `AnyPlayerMayPayEffect(cost, consequence?, consequenceIfNonePaid?)`, which asks
  each player in APNAP order whether to pay `cost`. The first to pay runs `consequence` and stops
  the loop; if no one pays, `consequenceIfNonePaid` runs. `AnyPlayerMayPay` reads the
  "if a player does, X" direction (Prowling Pangolin); `UnlessAnyPlayerPays` reads the inverse
  "X unless any player pays" direction (Aether Rift: "return it… unless any player pays 5 life").
  Supported costs: `Costs.pay.Sacrifice` (card selection) and `Costs.pay.PayLife` (yes/no). The
  surrounding pipeline's stored collections are carried into whichever consequence fires, so the
  consequence can reference cards gathered earlier in the same resolution (e.g. the discarded card,
  via `MoveCollection(from = "discarded", …)`).
- `RepeatWhileEffect(condition, effect, maxIterations?)` — run effect repeatedly while condition holds.

### Sequencing & conditional

- `CompositeEffect(effects)` — run effects in order. Card definitions use the facade
  `Effects.Composite(e1, e2, ...)` (vararg) or `Effects.Composite(effects, stopOnError?,
  descriptionOverride?, descriptionAmounts?)` (list + render options).
- `ForEachEffect(space, body)` — the **single compiled iteration effect**: run `body` once per item
  of a sealed `IterationSpace`. Five lowering facades keep the pre-unification authoring names
  (same precedent as `IfYouDoEffect` → `GatedEffect`); use the one matching the iteration source:
  - `ForEachTargetEffect(effects)` → `IterationSpace.Targets` — per chosen target; the body sees
    only the current target as `ContextTarget(0)`, fresh `storedCollections` (Kaboom!).
  - `ForEachPlayerEffect(players, effects)` → `IterationSpace.Players(players)` — per matching
    player; `controllerId` rebound so `Player.You` is the current player, `opponentId` recomputed,
    fresh `storedCollections` (Winds of Change, Bend or Break, One Ring to Rule Them All).
  - `ForEachInCollectionEffect(collection, effect)` → `IterationSpace.Collection(name)` — per
    entity of a named pipeline collection; `pipeline.iterationTarget` bound so `EffectTarget.Self`
    is the current entity; outer collections preserved (Fight or Flight).
  - `ForEachInGroupEffect(filter, effect, noRegenerate?)` / facade
    `Effects.ForEachInGroup(...)` → `IterationSpace.Group(filter, noRegenerate)` — per battlefield
    permanent matching a group filter; same `iterationTarget` binding as Collection.
  - `ForEachColorOfEffect(source, effect)` / facade `Effects.ForEachColorOf(...)` →
    `IterationSpace.ColorsOf(source)` — per color of an entity, WUBRG order, bound via the
    chosen-color channel (see the choice section).

  Every space snapshots its items before the first iteration (entities destroyed mid-loop stay in
  the list) and every space is **pause-safe**: a body that pauses for a decision resumes the
  remaining iterations via the shared `ForEachContinuation`. Multi-effect bodies lower to a
  `CompositeEffect`.
- `ConditionalEffect(condition, ifTrue, ifFalse?)` / `Branch(...)` — conditional branch. Facade
  preserved for existing cards; it now **lowers to `GatedEffect(Gate.WhenCondition(condition), then =
  ifTrue, otherwise = ifFalse)`** (compiled form is `Gated`, not a distinct `Conditional` type). It is
  a synchronous state test — no decision, no pause. Engine paths that recognize a conditional branch
  (stack-time branch resolution for opponent views, repeat-activation analysis, limited rating) key
  off the lowered `Gate.WhenCondition` shape via the `Effect.asConditional()` matcher.
- `IfYouDoEffect(action, ifYouDo, ifYouDont?, successCriterion?)` — "[action]. If you do, [ifYouDo].
  Otherwise, [ifYouDont]." Gates the payoff on whether `action` actually accomplished its work (a
  declined or no-op action runs `ifYouDont`, not `ifYouDo`) — not on a yes/no decision. Facade
  preserved for existing cards; it now **lowers to `GatedEffect(Gate.DoAction(action,
  successCriterion), then = ifYouDo, otherwise = ifYouDont)`** (compiled form is `Gated`, not a
  distinct `IfYouDo` type or executor). `successCriterion` defaults to `SuccessCriterion.Auto` (infer
  from the action's terminal zone-move); an action shape Auto *can't* infer from is a card-load
  validation error — state `SuccessCriterion.Always` / `CollectionNonEmpty(name, min)` explicitly
  there (and use them whenever the inference is wrong). Wrap with `MayEffect` for the optional
  "You may [action]. If you do, [effect]" shape.
- `ReflexiveTriggerEffect(action, reflexive, optional)` — same shape but the reflexive effect goes on the stack.
- **Branching on gathered properties** — "reveal/look, if it's a [type] do X, otherwise Y" needs no
  bespoke effect type; it is the partition + collection-gate composition:
  1. **Partition:** `FilterCollection(from, CollectionFilter.MatchesFilter(filter), storeMatching,
     storeNonMatching)` splits a gathered collection by any `GameObjectFilter` — deterministic, no
     player decision, no continuation.
  2. **Branch:** gate follow-up effects on the partition with
     `GatedEffect(Gate.WhenCondition(CollectionContainsMatch(name, filter?)))` (or `Not(...)` /
     `ConditionalOnCollectionEffect(name, ifNotEmpty, ifEmpty?, minSize?)`). Gate conditions are
     evaluated against the live `EffectContext`, so they see pipeline collections — **including
     collections written before an earlier pause** (a `SelectFromCollection` decision); the resumed
     pipeline context carries them.
  3. Effects that consume an empty collection (`MoveCollection`, `SelectFromCollection`,
     `AddCountersToCollection`) are silent no-ops, so the "nothing matched" leg often needs no gate
     at all — just move the (possibly empty) partition.
  Worked examples: `Patterns.Mechanic.explore()` (CR 701.44), Sindbad ("draw and reveal; if it isn't
  a land, discard it"), Cache Grab (Food gated on `CollectionContainsMatch("selected", Squirrel)`
  after a selection pause).

### Modal & choice

- `ModalEffect.chooseOne { mode(...) }` / `ModalEffect.chooseN(n) { ... }` — modal effect block.
- `ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen(*modes)` — "choose one that hasn't been chosen"; source remembers used modes across the game (Gandalf the Grey).
- `ChooseActionEffect(choices)` — player picks from a list of effects.
- `GrantProtectionFromColor(color, target, duration)` — grant protection from a **fixed** color to a target (no player choice); a thin recipe over `GrantKeyword("PROTECTION_FROM_<COLOR>")`. "{W}: Target creature gains protection from red until end of turn." (Crimson Acolyte).
- `GrantPlayerProtection(scope = ProtectionScope.Everything, duration = Duration.UntilYourNextTurn, target = Controller)` — grant a **player** protection from a `ProtectionScope` (CR 702.16); the player-level counterpart of the creature protection statics. For a player only the **D**amage and **T**argeting parts of DEBT apply: a protected player can't be the target of, nor be dealt damage by, a source matching the scope. Adds/merges a `PlayerProtectionComponent` (multiple grants stack their scopes); the targeting validator, target enumerator, and `DamageUtils` all consult the shared `PlayerProtectionRules`. `Duration.UntilYourNextTurn` clears it after the untap step of the player's next turn. "You gain protection from everything until your next turn." (The One Ring).
- `ChooseColorThenEffect(whenChosen)` — pick a color, then run a function of that color.
- `Effects.ChooseNumberThen(then, minValue=0, maxValue=16, prompt)` — pick a number in `[minValue, maxValue]`,
  then run `then` once with the chosen number exposed via the effect context as **X**. Atomic effects and filters
  under `then` read it through `ManaValueEqualsX` (`.manaValueEqualsX()`). Compose with `CompositeEffect` for
  multi-step cards (Void: destroy all artifacts/creatures with that mana value, then a target player reveals their
  hand and discards all nonland cards with that mana value).
- `GrantHexproofFromChosenColorEffect(target)` — hexproof from chosen color.
- `GrantProtectionFromChosenColorEffect(target)` — protection from chosen color. Must run inside `ChooseColorThen`; wrap in `ForEachInGroup` for the group case (Akroma's Blessing: "Creatures you control gain protection from the chosen color").
- `Effects.GrantProtectionFromChosenCardType(target, duration)` — "gains protection from the card type of your choice" (Pippin, Guard of the Citadel). The card-type analogue of `GrantProtectionFromChosenColor`, but **self-contained**: its executor owns the choice — it presents a `ChooseOptionDecision` over the fixed protectable card-type set (Artifact, Creature, Enchantment, Instant, Land, Planeswalker, Sorcery, Battle) and, on response, grants a floating `PROTECTION_FROM_CARDTYPE_<TYPE>` keyword for `duration`. The targeting validator, `StackResolver` spell-targeting, `DamageUtils`, the combat-damage pipeline/manager, and a `ProtectionFromCardTypeRule` block-evasion rule all match the protected keyword against the source's projected card types. (The "can't be enchanted/equipped by that type" clause is reminder text and unenforced at attach time, mirroring color/subtype protection.)
- `ChooseCreatureTypeEffect(...)` — pause for creature-type pick.
- `SelectTargetEffect(...)` — have a player pick from a valid set.

> **Authoring rule:** prefer composing primitives over adding parameters to an existing effect. Use `CompositeEffect`
> and the gather/select/move pipeline before writing a new executor.

## 5. Effect patterns (`Patterns.Library.*` / `Patterns.Hand.*` / `Patterns.Group.*` / `Patterns.Exile.*` / `Patterns.CreatureType.*` / `Patterns.Mechanic.*`)

Composed pipelines (`GatherCards → SelectFromCollection → MoveCollection` shapes and similar).
Named entries here are for named MTG mechanics and shapes with a demonstrated second user — a
one-off pipeline belongs inline in the card file via `Effects.Pipeline { }` (§5.5) instead.

**Library search & reveal**

- `searchLibrary(filter, destination?, tapped?, shuffle?)` — search library, pick matching, move, shuffle.
- `searchMultipleZones(filters, ...)` — search multiple zones in one effect.

**Top-deck manipulation**

- `scry(count)` — look at top N, bottom any, rest on top.
- `surveil(count)` — look at top N, any to graveyard, rest on top.
- `mill(count)` — top N cards into graveyard.
- `lookAtTopAndKeep(count, keepCount)` — Ancestral Memories — keep exactly K to hand.
- `lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand(count, filter, prompt, restDestination?, restOrder?)` — Radagast the
  Brown / Star Charter shape: look at top `count`, **optionally** reveal one card matching `filter` to
  hand, rest to `restDestination` (default bottom of library) in `restOrder` (default
  `CardOrder.Random`). `count` is a `DynamicAmount` (e.g. `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()`).
- `lookAtTopAndReorder(count)` — reorder top N.
- `manifest(count = 1)` — manifest the top N cards (CR 701.40): each is put onto the battlefield
  face down as a 2/2 creature (one at a time). A manifested creature card can be turned face up for
  its mana cost; a manifested non-creature can't.
- `manifestDread()` — "Manifest dread" (CR 701.62, Duskmourn): look at the top two cards of your
  library, manifest one of them (your choice), and put the other into your graveyard. Composes
  gather → select → move-face-down(MANIFEST) → move-to-graveyard.

**Reveal patterns**

- `revealUntilNonlandDealDamage(target)` — Bonecrusher Giant shape.
- `wheelEffect(players)` — each player shuffles hand into library, draws that many.
- `factOrFiction(count = 5, keepZone, otherZone, ...)` — reveal/look at the top `count`, an
  opponent splits them into two piles, then you choose which pile goes to `keepZone` (hand) and
  which to `otherZone` (graveyard). The shared CR 700.3 "divvy" pile-split primitive — also drives
  Sauron's Ransom (`count = 4`, chained `.then(Effects.TheRingTemptsYou())`).

**Hand manipulation**

- `discardCards(count, target)` — controller-of-target chooses (mandatory).
- `discardCardsUnlessMatching(count, unlessFilter, target?, reducedCount?, requiredMatches?)` /
  `Effects.DiscardUnlessMatching(...)` — one-step "discard N cards unless you discard a matching card" selection;
  a lower-count selection is valid only when it includes enough cards matching `unlessFilter`.
- `discardRandom(count, target)` — random discards.
- `discardHand(target)` — discard entire hand.
- `eachOpponentDiscards(count, controllerDrawsPerDiscard?)` — Mind Twist-style.
- `eachPlayerDiscardsDraws(controllerBonusDraw?)` — Windfall / Wheel of Fortune.
- `eachPlayerDrawsX(includeController?, includeOpponents?)` — Howling Mine shape.
- `eachPlayerMayDraw(maxCards, lifePerCardNotDrawn?)` — optional group draw with a tax.
- `exileFromHand(count?, target)` — exile N from hand.

**Sacrifice / destroy**

- `sacrifice(filter, count, then)` — sacrifice N, then run effect.
- `sacrificeFor(filter, countName, thenEffect)` — sacrifice variable count, store, then effect.
- `destroyAllPipeline(filter, noRegenerate?, storeDestroyedAs?)` — wrath pipeline with storage.
- `destroyAllAndAttachedPipeline(filter, noRegenerate?)` — wrath + attached.
- `destroyAllSharingTypeWithSacrificed(noRegenerate?)` — destroy all creatures sharing type with a sacrificed creature.

**Creature-type choice**

- `chooseCreatureTypeRevealTop()` — pick a type, reveal until matching.
- `chooseCreatureTypeReturnFromGraveyard(count)` — pick a type, return N from graveyard.
- `chooseCreatureTypeModifyStats(...)` — pick a type, buff matching.
- `chooseCreatureTypeUntap()` — pick a type, untap your matching.
- `chooseCreatureTypeGainControl(duration?)` — pick a type, control matching.
- `becomeChosenTypeAllCreatures(...)` — all creatures become the chosen type.

**Misc mechanic shapes**

- `mayPay(cost, effect)` — optionally pay cost to trigger an effect.
- `mayPayOrElse(cost, ifPaid, ifNotPaid)` — pay-or-else fork.
- `blight(amount, player?)` — Blight X additional cost glue.
- `bolster(amount)` — Bolster N (CR 701.36): controller chooses a creature with the least toughness among
  creatures they control and puts N +1/+1 counters on it. Non-targeting; no-op with no creatures. Composes
  Gather → `FilterCollection(CollectionFilter.LeastToughness)` → `SelectFromCollection(ChooseExactly 1)` →
  `AddCountersToCollection(+1/+1)`. Toughness is read from projected state for the least-toughness comparison.
- `explore(explorer?)` — Explore (CR 701.44): reveal the top card of your library; a land goes to your
  hand, otherwise the exploring permanent (default `EffectTarget.Self`) gets a +1/+1 counter and you may
  put the revealed card into your graveyard. Pure pipeline composition: Gather (revealed) →
  `FilterCollection(MatchesFilter(Land))` partition → `MoveCollection(land → hand)` →
  `GatedEffect(WhenCondition(Not(CollectionContainsMatch("explored", Land))))` over counter + optional
  graveyard move. The gate is "no land revealed" (not "a nonland was revealed") so an empty library still
  yields the counter, per CR 701.44a/b.
- `forage(afterEffect?)` — Forage cost; choose card-from-hand to play.
- `loot(draw?, discard?)` — "draw N, discard M" loop.
- `rummage(count?)` — discard then draw.
- `connive(target?)` — draw 1, discard 1, then put a +1/+1 counter on `target` if the discard was a nonland (CR 702.166). Also exposed as `Effects.Connive(target)`.
- `readTheRunes()` — "draw X cards; for each, discard a card unless you sacrifice a permanent." Composes `RepeatDynamicTimesEffect(XValue, ChooseActionEffect(...))` with feasibility guards. Exposed as `Effects.ReadTheRunes()`.
- `eachOpponentMayPutFromHand(filter?)` — each opponent may dump a matching card.
- `putFromHand(filter?, count?, entersTapped?, entersAttacking?)` — you may put N from hand onto
  battlefield. `entersAttacking = true` puts them in **tapped and attacking**
  (`ZonePlacement.TappedAndAttacking`; the engine adds an `AttackingComponent` against the defending
  player), e.g. Shadowfax, Lord of Horses ("put a creature card with lesser power from your hand onto
  the battlefield tapped and attacking").
- `incubate(n)` — make an Incubator token with N counters.
- `impulse(count?, expiry?)` — impulse draw: exile the top N of your library, may play those cards until `expiry` (default end of turn); played cards still pay their mana. For the play-free variant compose with `GrantPlayWithoutPayingCostEffect` (cf. `shuffleAndExileTopPlayFree`). Irascible Wolverine (1), Annie Flash, the Veteran (2).
- `returnLinkedExile(underOwnersControl?)` — bring back linked exile pile.
- `takeFromLinkedExile()` — pull one card from linked exile.
- `shuffleGraveyardIntoLibrary(target?)` — Elixir of Immortality shape.
- `reflexiveTrigger(action, whenYouDo, optional?)` — optional action; if taken, queue a reflexive trigger.

**Group bulk operations** (one effect applied to every permanent matching a `GroupFilter`)

- `modifyStatsForAll(power, toughness, filter, duration?)` — give every match +X/+Y (`Int` or `DynamicAmount`).
- `doublePowerAndToughnessForAll(filter, duration?)` — double each match's power and toughness. Resolves to a fixed +P/+T modification read per-entity from projected state via `DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(EntityReference.IterationEntity, …)`, so the bonus locks in at resolution (no re-doubling) and negative power doubles correctly. Roar of Endless Song, Unnatural Growth.
- `grantKeywordToAll(keyword, filter, duration?)` / `removeKeywordFromAll(...)`; `tapAll(filter)` / `untapGroup(filter?)`; `dealDamageToAll(amount, filter)`; `destroyAll(filter, noRegenerate?)`; `gainControlOfGroup(filter?, duration?)`.
- `GroupFilter` exclusion flags: `excludeSelf` (`.other()`) drops the resolving **source** from the group; `excludeTarget` (`.otherThanTarget()`) drops the spell/ability's **first chosen target**. Combine `GameObjectFilter.Creature.targetPlayerControls(EffectTarget.TargetController)` with `.otherThanTarget()` for "each other creature with the same controller [as the target]" — Fear, Fire, Foes!: `dealDamageToAll(1, GroupFilter(Creature.targetPlayerControls(TargetController)).otherThanTarget())`.

## 5.5 Inline pipelines (`Effects.Pipeline { }`)

The facade-respecting way to compose a **one-off** Gather → Select → Move pipeline inside a card
file (see `backlog/inline-pipeline-dsl.md`). Named `Patterns.*` entries are for named MTG mechanics
and shapes with a demonstrated second user; one-off pipelines go inline via the builder instead of
hand-threading string slot keys between raw step constructors.

Each builder verb serializes to the existing pipeline step `Effect` — the result is the exact same
`CompositeEffect` tree the raw constructors produce (zero engine change, zero JSON-contract change).
Steps return **typed slot handles**; the only way to obtain a handle is from a step that produced
it, so a read-without-write (the `CardLinter` dangling-slot error class) cannot be expressed.

```kotlin
effect = Effects.Pipeline {
    val looked = gather(CardSource.TopOfLibrary(DynamicAmount.Fixed(7)))
    val (kept, rest) = chooseExactlySplit(2, from = looked)
    toHand(kept)
    toGraveyard(rest)
}
```

**Slot handles** (one per `EffectContext` namespace, mirroring `CardLinter.Space`):

| Handle | Backing store | Produced by | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CollectionSlot` | `storedCollections` | `gather`, `chooseExactly`, `filter`, `captureControllers`, `moveTracked`, … | `move`, `reveal`, the select/filter verbs, `forEachCaptured` |
| `NumberSlot` | `storedNumbers` | `storeNumber`, `forEachCaptured`'s block param | `.amount` → `DynamicAmount.VariableReference` |
| `ChosenSlot` | `chosenValues` | `storeCardName`, `chooseOption`, `noteCreatureType` | `GameObjectFilter.namedFromVariable(slot)` |
| `SubtypeGroupsSlot` | `storedSubtypeGroups` | `gatherSubtypes` | subtype-matching filters |

**Keys are auto-generated deterministically** — `"<verb><stepIndex>"` per builder instance
(`gathered0`, `selected1`, `matching3`), so renaming a Kotlin `val` never churns the serialized
JSON, while reordering steps changes keys (the tree changed anyway). Every producing step takes an
optional `name = "..."` override: use it for readable goldens on gnarly cards and for **churn-free
migration** of existing inline cards (keep the old hand-written keys → byte-identical JSON,
untouched snapshot goldens; `inv/cards/Lobotomy.kt` is the worked example). Duplicate explicit
names, empty pipelines, and empty branch blocks fail at card-load with `require`.

**Step vocabulary** (one verb per existing step type — the vocabulary grows with step types, never
with cards):

| Builder verb | Serializes to |
|---|---|
| `gather(source)` / `gather(filter, player?, …)` (battlefield shorthand) | `GatherCardsEffect` |
| `gatherUntilMatch(filter, …)` → `(match, revealed)` | `GatherUntilMatchEffect` |
| `chooseExactly(n, from)` / `chooseUpTo` / `chooseAnyNumber` / `chooseRandom` / `selectAll` (+ `…Split` variants returning `(selected, remainder)`) | `SelectFromCollectionEffect` |
| `filter(from, filter)` / `filterSplit(…)` → `(matching, rest)` | `FilterCollectionEffect` |
| `move(from, destination, …)` / `moveTracked(…)` / sugar `destroy`, `sacrifice`, `exile`, `toHand`, `toGraveyard`, `toLibraryTop`, `toLibraryBottom` | `MoveCollectionEffect` |
| `reveal(from, …)` | `RevealCollectionEffect` |
| `captureControllers(from)` | `CaptureControllersEffect` |
| `forEachCaptured(collection, original, controllers) { count -> … }` | `ForEachCapturedControllerEffect` |
| `gatherSubtypes(from)` | `GatherSubtypesEffect` |
| `storeCardName(from)` | `StoreCardNameEffect` |
| `storeNumber(amount)` | `StoreNumberEffect` |
| `chooseOption(optionType, …)` / `noteCreatureType(…)` | `ChooseOptionEffect` / `NoteCreatureTypeEffect` |
| `choosePile(a, b, chooser?, …)` → `(chosen, other)` | `ChoosePileEffect` |
| `selectTarget(requirement)` (resolution-time choice — never printed "target") | `SelectTargetEffect` |
| `ifNotEmpty(slot, filter?, minSize?) { … } orElse { … }` | `ConditionalOnCollectionEffect` |
| `whenMatches(slot, filter)` (returns a `Condition`, adds no step) | `CollectionContainsMatch` |
| `run(effect)` | any other `Effect`, verbatim |

`run(...)` keeps the builder open: non-pipeline effects (a `ShuffleLibraryEffect`, a damage effect)
interleave without the builder needing a verb for everything. Optional secondary outputs
(`storeRemainder`, `storeNonMatching`, `storeMovedAs`) are only serialized when the card actually
requests the handle (`chooseExactlySplit`, `filterSplit`, `moveTracked`), keeping emitted JSON free
of never-read writes.

**Branch scoping** matches the engine's `EffectContext`: handles from the outer scope are visible
inside `ifNotEmpty` / `forEachCaptured` blocks by plain lexical capture (branches don't start fresh
scopes; nested *abilities* do). Branch bodies with one step stay bare; multiple steps wrap in a
nested `CompositeEffect`. Nested scopes share the key counter, so auto-keys never collide.

```kotlin
// Branch-on-gathered (the PR #618 idiom):
effect = Effects.Pipeline {
    val drawn = gather(CardSource.TopOfLibrary(DynamicAmount.Fixed(1)))
    reveal(drawn)
    ifNotEmpty(drawn, filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature) {
        toHand(drawn)
    } orElse {
        toGraveyard(drawn)
    }
}
```

**Special `gather` sources** (component-backed, no zone scan):

- `CardSource.Self` — the ability's own source card, in whatever zone it currently sits.
- `CardSource.TappedAsCost` — the permanents tapped to pay the activation cost.
- `CardSource.ChosenTargets` — the spell/ability's already-resolved targets.
- `CardSource.FromLinkedExile(count?)` — the cards in the source's linked-exile pile.
- `CardSource.LastKnownCombatPairedWithSource` — creatures blocking/blocked by the source at the
  moment it last left the battlefield (Abu Ja'far).
- `CardSource.CreaturesThatSaddledSource` — the creatures that saddled the source Mount this turn
  (CR 702.171c), read off its crew/saddle-contributors record and restricted to creatures still on
  the battlefield. Backs "exile it and up to one creature that saddled it this turn, then return
  those cards" (Fortune, Loyal Steed): `gather(CreaturesThatSaddledSource)` → `chooseUpTo(1)` →
  exile linked to the Mount alongside `CardSource.Self` → `gather(FromLinkedExile())` → return
  under owners' control.

A card needing a genuinely **new step semantic** (a new capture kind, a new decision shape) still
adds the `Effect` + executor first (`add-feature`); the builder only composes the existing
vocabulary. The JSON/custom-card authoring path is unchanged — raw step types stay `@Serializable`
with string keys, and `CardLinter` remains the backstop for that path and for anything the builder
can't statically prevent (cross-trigger flows, `Self`-vs-`ContextTarget` inside `ForEach`).

## 6. Targets

### Resolution-time (`EffectTarget`)

- `EffectTarget.ContextTarget(i)` — i-th cast-time target.
- `EffectTarget.Controller` — controller of the source ability.
- `EffectTarget.Self` — the source permanent.
- `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` — the entity that caused the trigger to fire.
- `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(...)` — a player slot; see the `Player` reference list below.

**`Player` references** (multiplayer-safe vocabulary — there is deliberately no bare
`Player.Opponent`; every reference says *which* player it means):

- `Player.You` — the controller of the ability/effect.
- `Player.Each` — all players (active players only; lost players are skipped).
- `Player.EachOpponent` — all of your opponents. Also the *matching* form for "an opponent"
  in event filters (`SpellCastEvent(player = …)`), exists-conditions, and battlefield
  aggregations ("creatures your opponents control").
- `Player.ActivePlayerFirst` — all players in APNAP order.
- `Player.TargetPlayer` / `Player.TargetOpponent` — the bound player target (resolved from the
  chosen targets, never from turn order).
- `Player.DefendingPlayer` — CR 802.2a: the player the ability's source is attacking, read from
  the source's attack assignment (a creature attacking a planeswalker defends against its
  controller); falls back to the trigger's damaged player as last-known information for "deals
  combat damage to a player" triggers. Use for attack/combat-damage triggers ("defending player
  mills four cards", "that player sacrifices a creature").
- `Player.TriggeringPlayer` — the player bound by the trigger (the caster for `SpellCastEvent`,
  the active player for per-player step triggers — "at the beginning of each opponent's upkeep,
  *that player* …").
- `Player.AnOpponent` — a genuinely non-targeted "an opponent" (a chooser: "an opponent chooses a
  creature type"). Currently resolves to the first opponent in turn order; the proper multiplayer
  choice flow is tracked in `backlog/multiplayer.md`. Do **not** use it where the text means
  `TargetOpponent`, `EachOpponent`, `DefendingPlayer`, or `TriggeringPlayer`.
- `Player.ChosenOpponent` — the opponent locked into the source's `ChoiceSlot.OPPONENT` slot.
- `Player.ControllerOf(desc)` / `Player.OwnerOf(desc)` — controller/owner of the first chosen target.
- `Player.ContextPlayer(i)` / `Player.Candidate` / `Player.Any` — positional target, CR 115
  candidate during target-restriction evaluation, and "a player" matching.
- `EffectTarget.ContextProperty(key)` — value plumbed into `EffectContext` (damage amount, life gained, blight
  amount, …).
- `EnchantedCreature` / `EquippedCreature` — resolve via `AttachedToComponent`; requires the state-aware
  `resolveTarget(state, target)` overload.
- `EnchantedPermanent` — same `AttachedToComponent` resolution as `EnchantedCreature`, but type-agnostic; use for
  Auras that enchant non-creature permanents (e.g. Wellspring enchants a land: "gain control of enchanted land").
- `AttachedToTriggeringPermanent` — inside a `Triggers.becomesAttached` trigger, the permanent the
  triggering attachment (Aura/Equipment) became attached to. Resolved live from the triggering
  object's `AttachedToComponent` (so a "for as long as attached" payoff does nothing if the
  attachment already left — CR 611.2b). Used by Eriette ("gain control of that permanent") and
  Assimilation Aegis ("that creature becomes a copy …").

### Cast-time (`Targets.*` / `TargetRequirement`)

- `Targets.Any` — any creature, player, or planeswalker.
- `Targets.AnyChosenByOpponent` — "any target **of an opponent's choice**" (Cuombajj Witches). A real
  target of *your* spell/ability that an **opponent** selects: announced at the same time as your own
  targets, equally respondable, and with legality (hexproof/protection/shroud) measured relative to
  **you, the controller** — so an opponent can't pick a hexproof creature they control. Desugars to
  `AnyTarget(chooser = TargetChooser.Opponent)`; any `TargetRequirement` can carry `chooser` (see
  below). List the opponent-chosen requirement *after* the controller-chosen ones in a script. The
  engine routes the opponent's selection at announcement for **activated abilities** (the only printed
  use today); the controller picks which opponent in multiplayer (currently defaults to the sole
  opponent — see `TargetChooser`).
- `Targets.AnyOtherThanEnchantedCreature` — any target except the creature the source Aura/Equipment
  is attached to. Desugars to `TargetOther(AnyTarget(), excludeAttachedCreature = true)`; for Aura/Equipment
  abilities worded "enchanted/equipped creature deals damage … to **any other target**" (e.g. Pain for All),
  where the dealer is the attached creature, not the ability's source permanent.
- `Targets.Creature` — any creature.
- `Targets.CreatureYouControl` / `CreatureOpponentControls` — controller-restricted.
- `Targets.OtherCreatureYouControl` — "another target creature you control"; excludes the source.
- `Targets.Player` — any player.
- `Targets.Planeswalker` — any planeswalker.
- `Targets.Permanent` — any permanent.
- `Targets.NonlandPermanent` — any nonland permanent.
- `Targets.Artifact` — any artifact.
- `Targets.Enchantment` — any enchantment.
- `Targets.Land` — any land.
- `Targets.ArtifactOrLand` — any artifact or land (Territory Forge).
- `Targets.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Targets.Spell` — any spell on the stack.
- `Targets.InstantOrSorcerySpellYouControl` — an instant or sorcery spell on the stack you control (copy-your-spell modes).
- `Targets.CreatureSpellYouControl` — a creature spell on the stack you control (Choreographed Sparks' "Copy target creature spell you control").
- `Targets.ActivatedOrTriggeredAbility` / `Targets.ActivatedAbility` — an ability on the stack (Stifle).
- `Targets.SpellOrAbilityWithSingleTarget` — a spell or ability whose single target is changed (Willbender; pair with `Effects.ChangeTarget()`).
- `Targets.InstantSorcerySpellOrAbility` — one requirement admitting an instant spell, sorcery spell, activated ability, or triggered ability on the stack (`TargetFilter.InstantSorcerySpellOrAbilityOnStack`, a single `CardPredicate.Or`). Pair with `Effects.CopyTargetSpellOrAbility()` — Return the Favor. **Note:** the STACK targeting enumeration (`TargetFinder.findSpellTargets`) offers an ability as a legal target only when the requirement's filter *explicitly names an ability predicate* (anywhere inside `Or`/`And`/`Not`); plain "target spell" filters stay spell-only (CR 112.1 vs 113.3b/c).
- `Targets.Card` — any card in any zone (e.g. graveyard).
- `Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker` — combined.
- `Targets.TappedCreature` / `UntappedCreature` — state-restricted.
- `Targets.InstantOrSorcery` — instant-or-sorcery card.

**Chained predicates** — `.youControl()`, `.controlledByOpponent()`, `.opponent()`, `.withSubtype(...)`,
`.withKeyword(...)`, `.ofColor(...)`, `.tapped()`, `.untapped()`, `.power(n)`, `.minPower(n)`, `.maxPower(n)`,
`.targetsMatching(subfilter)` (a spell/ability on the stack that targets at least one object matching
`subfilter` — `CardPredicate.TargetsMatching`; e.g. `GameObjectFilter.InstantOrSorcery.targetsMatching(GameObjectFilter.Creature)`
for "an instant or sorcery spell that targets a creature" — Forum Necroscribe, Lecturing Scornmage);
plus `TargetFilter.excludeSelf` to exclude the source.

### Named multi-target binding

```kotlin
spell {
    val creature = target("creature", Targets.Creature)
    val player = target("player", Targets.Player)
    effect = Effects.Composite(
        Effects.Destroy(creature),
        Effects.DealDamage(3, player),
    )
}
```

For modal spells, prefer the explicit `targetPlayerControls(target)` DSL form; per-mode targets route via
`modeTargetsOrdered`.

### Target count

Every `TargetRequirement` carries count semantics (defaults shown):

- `count = 1` — maximum number of targets.
- `minCount = count` — minimum; set below `count` for "one or two target creatures".
- `optional = false` — when `true`, minimum becomes 0 ("up to N target ..."). An activated ability
  whose controller-chosen requirements are **all** optional (e.g. Boom Box's "Destroy up to one target
  artifact, up to one target creature, and up to one target land") is legal to activate with an *empty*
  target list — choosing no targets for every slot — and still resolves; the engine only requires a
  target when at least one controller requirement has a non-zero effective minimum.
- `unlimited = false` — when `true`, **"any number of target ..."** — no upper cap. The practical
  maximum is the number of legal targets, which the engine sends to the client; validation imposes
  no limit and the minimum is 0. Use this instead of a large placeholder `count` (Phyrexian Purge,
  Kaboom, Weaver of Lies). Available on `TargetObject` / `TargetCreature(...)` / `TargetPlayer` and
  on `TargetOpponent` — `TargetOpponent(unlimited = true)` is "any number of target opponents"
  (Hollow Marauder); pair with `ForEachTargetEffect` to apply a per-opponent body. Works on
  **triggered abilities** as well as spells — `TargetPlayer(unlimited = true)` on a triggered
  ability sizes the decision's `maxTargets` to the legal-target count (Tinybones Joins Up's
  "any number of target players each discard a card"). For "**X** target
  creatures" use `dynamicMaxCount = DynamicAmount.XValue` instead — that clamps the count to the chosen X.
- `dynamicMaxCount: DynamicAmount?` — evaluated when the spell/ability hits the stack; the resolved
  value becomes the max ("up to X target creatures", X = board state or chosen X).
- `sameController = false` — on `TargetObject` / `TargetCreature(...)`; when `true` and the requirement
  picks more than one target, every chosen target must share a controller ("**two target creatures
  controlled by the same player**"). Enforced cross-target by `TargetValidator` at cast time using
  projected control; a no-op for single-target requirements. E.g.
  `TargetCreature(count = 2, sameController = true)` (Barrin's Spite).
- `sameOwner = false` — on `TargetObject`; when `true` and the requirement picks more than one target,
  every chosen **card** target must share an owner ("**exile up to two target cards from a single
  graveyard**"). Enforced cross-target both at cast time (`TargetValidator`) and on triggered-ability
  target decisions (`DecisionValidators` reads each card's `OwnerComponent`); a no-op for single-target
  requirements and for non-card targets. E.g.
  `TargetObject(count = 2, optional = true, filter = TargetFilter.CardInGraveyard, sameOwner = true)`
  (Arashin Sunshield).
- `chooser = TargetChooser.Controller` — **who selects this requirement's target(s)**. Set to
  `TargetChooser.Opponent` for "**… of an opponent's choice**" wording (Cuombajj Witches). The chosen
  target is still a real target of *your* spell/ability — announced together with your own targets,
  equally respondable, legality measured relative to **you** — but an opponent picks which legal
  object/player it is (the controller chooses *which* opponent in multiplayer per CR 601.6a/602.3a, and
  that pick follows the controller's own choices per CR 601.6b/602.3b). Orthogonal to legality: target-finding and
  validation ignore `chooser` (always relative to the controller); only the announcement layer reads it
  to route the selection decision. Honored for **activated abilities** today; list the opponent-chosen
  requirement after the controller-chosen ones. `Targets.AnyChosenByOpponent` is the ready-made
  "any target of an opponent's choice". `CardLinter` (§21) fails any card that puts a
  `TargetChooser.Opponent` target outside an activated ability — a spell or triggered ability would
  silently let the *controller* choose it instead.

### Player-target restrictions (`TargetPlayer.restriction` / `TargetOpponent.restriction`)

A `TargetPlayer` / `TargetOpponent` can carry `restriction: Condition?` — a gate each candidate
player must satisfy to be a legal target ("target player who lost life this turn", "target player
with 10 or less life"). The restriction is evaluated against each player with
`Player.Candidate` bound to that player, in all three target paths: legal-target enumeration,
cast/activation validation, and the CR 608.2b re-check at resolution (a target whose restriction
stopped holding — e.g. gained life above the threshold — is removed, fizzling a single-target spell).

Author the restriction through the `Conditions.candidate*` facade (never hand-write `Player.Candidate`):

- `Conditions.candidateLostLifeThisTurn()` — the targeted player lost life this turn (Rix Maadi Guildmage).
- `Conditions.candidateLifeAtMost(n)` — the targeted player has `n` or less life.

Because `Condition` descriptions don't read as English relative clauses, pass `descriptionOverride`
whenever `restriction` is set:

```kotlin
target(
    "target player who lost life this turn",
    TargetPlayer(
        restriction = Conditions.candidateLostLifeThisTurn(),
        descriptionOverride = "target player who lost life this turn",
    ),
)
```

This is the player-arm prerequisite for the planned composable mixed `TargetUnion` (see
`backlog/target-union-with-arms.md`).

## 7. Filters & predicates

### `GameObjectFilter` — for searches, sacrifice, group effects

- `Filters.AnyCard` — any card.
- `Filters.Creature` — any creature card.
- `Filters.Land` — any land card.
- `Filters.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Filters.PlainsCard` / `IslandCard` / `SwampCard` / `MountainCard` / `ForestCard` — specific basics.
- `Filters.Instant` — instant card.
- `Filters.Sorcery` — sorcery card.
- `Filters.Permanent` — permanent card.
- `Filters.NonlandPermanent` — nonland permanent.
- `Filters.WithSubtype(subtype)` — card of a given subtype.
- `GameObjectFilter.Multicolored` — multicolored card (two or more colors; `CardPredicate.IsMulticolored`).
- `CardPredicate.IsColored` — one or more colors (the complement of `IsColorless`). Used for "a
  permanent that's one or more colors" (Ugin, Eye of the Storms). Pair with `IsPermanent` for the
  colored-permanent target filter; pair `IsColorless` with `IsNonland` for "colorless nonland card".
- **Type-negation predicates** `CardPredicate.IsNonland` / `IsNoncreature` / `IsNonenchantment` /
  `IsNonartifact` — "is not a \<type\>". Named filter constants `GameObjectFilter.Nonland` /
  `Noncreature` / `Nonenchantment` / `Nonartifact` wrap each. `IsNonartifact` is the "nonartifact
  creature" leg of the Terror template ("destroy target nonartifact, nonblack creature") — pair with
  `IsCreature` + `.notColor(...)`. FQL keys: `nonland` / `noncreature` / `nonartifact`.

**Chained predicates**

- `.youControl()` / `.controlledByOpponent()` — control predicate.
- `.controlledByActivePlayer()` — controlled by the player whose turn it is (`ControllerPredicate.ControlledByActivePlayer`).
  Pairs with `Triggers.EachUpkeep` for "at the beginning of each player's upkeep, do X to permanents that player
  controls" (the upkeep player is the active player — Temporal Distortion).
- `.targetPlayerControls(target)` — controlled by a referenced player. Resolves `EffectTarget`
  bindings/context targets, plus `EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity` (controller of the
  entity that fired the trigger — e.g. Tectonic Instability "tap all lands its controller controls").
- `.ownedByYou()` / `.ownedByOpponent()` — owner predicates (for graveyard/exile cards without a
  controller, and "you own" battlefield wordings).
- `.withControllerPredicate(p)` — set any `ControllerPredicate` directly; the entry point for the
  **composed** predicates `ControllerPredicate.And(list)` / `Or(list)` / `Not(p)`, which express
  heterogeneous controller/owner relationships in one filter — e.g. "creatures you own but don't
  control" = `withControllerPredicate(And(listOf(OwnedByYou, Not(ControlledByYou))))`. Every engine
  evaluation site (live projection, zone-change last-known-controller, grant fast paths) shares the
  combinator recursion via the `evaluateWith` fold next to `ControllerPredicate`. Note that
  `GameObjectFilter.and` **rejects** two sides carrying *different* controller predicates (it used
  to silently keep only one) — state the intent with a composed predicate instead.
- `.withSubtype(s)` / `.withKeyword(k)` — type/ability predicate.
- `.ofColor(c)` / `.ofColors(set)` — color predicate.
- `.withColor(c)` / `.withAnyColor(c…)` / `.notColor(c)` — fixed-color predicates (`CardPredicate.HasColor`/`NotColor`).
- `.nonartifact()` — appends `CardPredicate.IsNonartifact` ("nonartifact creature", the Terror template);
  the type-negation analogue of `.notColor(c)` / `.notSubtype(s)`.
- `.notCreature()` — appends `CardPredicate.Not(CardPredicate.IsCreature)` ("noncreature artifact",
  e.g. `GameObjectFilter.Artifact.notCreature().youControl()` — Guardian Beast).
- `.nonbasic()` — appends `CardPredicate.Not(CardPredicate.IsBasicLand)` ("nonbasic land"); compose on
  the land base (`GameObjectFilter.Land.nonbasic()`), or use the named constant `GameObjectFilter.NonbasicLand`
  / `TargetFilter.NonbasicLand` (Rocket Volley, Shivan Harvest, Encroaching Wastes). `TargetFilter.Land.nonbasic()`
  is the target-side passthrough.
- `.withChosenColor()` — `CardPredicate.HasChosenColor`: matches the color chosen during the current
  effect's resolution (read from `EffectContext.chosenColor`, set by `Effects.ChooseColorThen`). Use with
  `AggregateBattlefield(Player.Each, …)` for "for each permanent of that color" (Coalition Dragon cycle).
- `.sharingCreatureTypeWith(entity)` — `CardPredicate.SharesCreatureTypeWith(entity)`: shares ≥1 (projected)
  creature subtype with a referenced entity. `entity` may be `EntityReference.AffectedEntity`, which resolves
  to the creature a continuous effect is being applied to during projection — combine with
  `AggregateBattlefield(Player.Each, GameObjectFilter.Creature.sharingCreatureTypeWith(EntityReference.AffectedEntity), excludeSelf = true)`
  for "+X/+X for each OTHER creature that shares a creature type with it" (Alpha Status). In a granted
  context `excludeSelf` excludes the affected (enchanted) creature, not the granting source.
- `.sharingColorWith(entity)` — `CardPredicate.SharesColorWith(entity)`: shares ≥1 (projected) color with
  a referenced entity (e.g. `EntityReference.Triggering`). Mirror of `.sharingCreatureTypeWith(entity)`.
  Colorless entities share no color (never match). Used by Spreading Plague ("destroy all other creatures
  that share a color with it") — pair with `Effects.DestroyAll(filter, excludeTriggering = true)` so the
  triggering creature itself is spared.
- `.sharingColorWithPermanentYouControl(filter)` — `CardPredicate.SharesColorWithPermanentYouControl`:
  shares ≥1 (projected) color with at least one permanent the evaluating player controls matching
  `filter`. Used by Ringsight ("search your library for a card that shares a color with a legendary
  creature you control") with `filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.legendary()`. Colorless candidates
  never match. Evaluated for real in targeting/search/count contexts; inert (false) in
  static-projection / trigger-gating, permissive (true) in cost-calculation.
- `.notSharingCreatureTypeWithPermanentYouControl(filter)` —
  `CardPredicate.DoesNotShareCreatureTypeWithPermanentYouControl`: shares **no** (projected) creature
  type with any permanent the evaluating player controls matching `filter`. Negative analogue of
  `.sharingColorWithPermanentYouControl`. Used by Radagast the Brown ("a creature card that doesn't share
  a creature type with a creature you control") with `filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature`. A candidate
  with no creature types of its own shares none, so it matches.
- `.named(name)` — `CardPredicate.NameEquals`: matches a fixed card name.
- `.namedFromVariable(variableName)` — `CardPredicate.NameEqualsChosen`: matches the card name stored in
  `chosenValues[variableName]` (case-insensitive). Set the name with `Effects.ChooseCardName` (player names it)
  or `Effects.StoreCardName` (captured from a chosen card). Fails closed in static/projection contexts. Used by
  the "name a card … cards with that name" family (Desperate Research, Lobotomy).
- `.namedFromChosenComponent(slot = ChoiceSlot.CARD_NAME)` — `CardPredicate.NameEqualsChosenComponent`: matches
  the card name **durably chosen by the source permanent as it entered** — read from that permanent's
  `CastChoicesComponent` under `slot` (case-insensitive). Unlike `.namedFromVariable` (transient pipeline variable,
  fails closed in projection), this is **static-projection / activation-legality safe**: it keys off the granting
  permanent's id, which the predicate context supplies as the source wherever a static ability's filter is
  evaluated. Pair with `replacementEffect(EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.CARD_NAME))`. Fails closed (no match) before
  a name is chosen. Used by name-keyed static abilities (Petrified Hamlet — "sources with the chosen name … /
  Lands with the chosen name …").
- `.power(n)` / `.minPower(n)` / `.maxPower(n)` — P/T comparator.
- `.manaValue(n)` / `.manaValueAtMost(n)` / `.manaValueAtLeast(n)` — mana-value comparator.
- `.manaValueAtMostX()` — mana value ≤ the X chosen for the source spell/ability.
- `.manaValueEqualsX()` — mana value **exactly equal** to the X chosen for the source spell/ability (the chosen
  number, or the X paid in an `{X}…` mana cost; resolution-time only — matches nothing without a chosen number).
  Available on both the object-filter builders and on `TargetFilter` (mirrors `.manaValueAtMostX()`). Used by Void
  (`Effects.ChooseNumberThen`) and Repeal (`{X}{U}` — return target nonland permanent with mana value X).
- `.manaValueAtMostEntity(ref)` — mana value ≤ a referenced entity's mana value (e.g. Kodama of the East Tree).
- `.powerEqualsX()` — **projected power exactly equal** to the X chosen for the source spell/ability — the power
  analogue of `.manaValueEqualsX()`. Available on both the object-filter builders and on `TargetFilter`. Used by an
  X-cost activated ability that targets "a creature with power X" (Ent-Draught Basin: `{X}, {T}: Put a +1/+1
  counter on target creature with power X`). Legal-action enumeration runs before X is bound, so it matches
  permissively then (the client re-filters by the chosen X via the `xConstrainsTargetPower` /
  `LegalActionTargetInfo.xConstrainsPower` flags); activation-time validation re-checks with X bound and rejects
  any creature whose power isn't exactly X.
- `.powerGreaterThanEntity(ref)` — power strictly greater than a referenced entity's projected power. Used by
  Éowyn, Fearless Knight ("exile target creature an opponent controls with greater power") — combine
  with `EntityReference.Source` to express "greater power than the ability's source".
- `.powerAtMostEntity(ref)` / `.powerLessThanEntity(ref)` — power ≤ (resp. **strictly** <) a referenced
  entity's projected power; inverses of `.powerGreaterThanEntity`. `powerAtMostEntity` backs Old Man of
  the Sea ("power less than or equal to this creature's power"); `powerLessThanEntity` backs "a creature
  with lesser power" (Rangers of Ithilien). Pair with `EntityReference.Source` for "than the source", or
  with `EntityReference.AmassedArmy` for a **resolution-time pipeline** bound — Grishnákh, Brash Instigator
  ("power ≤ the amassed Army's power"). The pipeline reference is threaded into target enumeration via
  `findLegalTargets(..., pipelineContext = …)`; see §13 "Pipeline values inside target filters".
- `.manaValueAtMostEntityManaSpent(ref)` — mana value ≤ the mana **actually spent** to cast a referenced
  entity. Reads the live `SpellOnStackComponent` buckets while the entity is still a spell, or the
  `CastRecordComponent` snapshot once it has resolved onto the battlefield (0 if it was never cast).
  Used by Edge of Eternities warp payoffs like Astelli Reclaimer ("…mana value X or less…, where X is the
  amount of mana spent to cast this creature") — X is 5 for `{3}{W}{W}`, 3 for warp `{2}{W}`, 0 for free.
- `.manaValueAtMostColorsSpent(ref)` — mana value ≤ the number of distinct **colors** of mana spent to
  cast a referenced entity (0–5). Sibling of `.manaValueAtMostEntityManaSpent`, but compares against the
  color *count* rather than total mana (colorless is not a color). The **Converge** exile-by-color-count
  gate — Sundering Archaic ("exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls with mana value less than
  or equal to the number of colors of mana spent to cast this creature"), with `EntityReference.Source`.
- `.manaValueAtMostDynamic(amount)` — mana value ≤ a resolved `DynamicAmount`. The open-ended
  "mana value X or less, where X is <some game value>" cap, for sources no fixed/entity-derived sibling
  covers: feed it any `DynamicAmount` (a `TurnTracking` total, a count over a filter, a life total, an
  arithmetic composition, …) and the engine evaluates it against the controller/source at evaluation
  time. **Moseo, Vein's New Dean** — "return … a creature card with mana value X or less from your
  graveyard …, where X is the amount of life you gained this turn" — uses
  `.manaValueAtMostDynamic(DynamicAmount.TurnTracking(Player.You, TurnTracker.LIFE_GAINED))`. The cap
  fails closed (matches nothing) when there is no controller context to resolve a player-scoped amount,
  and is `false` in the layer-projection / cost-calculation / cast-record paths (no resolution context),
  matching the other entity-relative caps.
- `.manaValueIsOdd()` / `.manaValueIsEven()` — mana-value parity (zero is even). Pair with modal
  spells whose modes ask the caster to choose a parity (e.g. *Mutinous Massacre*).
- `.hasXInManaCost()` — the card's **printed** mana cost contains an `{X}` symbol (inspects
  `manaCost.hasX`, not the computed mana value), so a spell cast with X=0 still matches by its
  printed cost. Face-down objects (no mana cost) never match; the cast-record path returns `false`
  (a record stores the resolved mana value, not the printed cost). Used by *Paradox Surveyor*
  ("a card with {X} in its mana cost"). Underlying predicate: `CardPredicate.HasXInManaCost`.
- `.toughnessAtMost(n)` / `.toughnessAtLeast(n)` — toughness comparator.
- `.powerOrToughnessAtLeast(n)` / `.powerOrToughnessAtMost(n)` — **OR** caps over power and
  toughness: matches when *either* power or toughness is ≥ (resp. ≤) `n`. `powerOrToughnessAtMost`
  backs Arnyn, Deathbloom Botanist ("a creature you control with power or toughness 1 or less
  dies"). Honored in all four evaluation sites (resolution predicate, trigger matcher with
  last-known stats, layer projection, cost calculation). Underlying predicates:
  `CardPredicate.PowerOrToughnessAtLeast` / `CardPredicate.PowerOrToughnessAtMost`.
- `.toughnessAtMostX()` — toughness ≤ the X chosen for the source spell/ability. Resolves
  against `PredicateContext.xValue` at evaluation time, so it works at the spell's resolution
  filter pass (e.g. Zero Point Ballad's mass destruction). Layer projection / trigger matching
  / cost calculation report `false` (no X context).
- `.tapped()` / `.untapped()` — tap state.
- `.dealtDamageThisTurn()` — was dealt damage this turn (marked-damage *history*, not current marked
  damage); backed by `StatePredicate.WasDealtDamageThisTurn`. Survives damage removal / leaving combat;
  cleared at end-of-turn cleanup. For "...that was dealt damage this turn" (Rooftop Assassin, Unsparing
  Boltcaster). Also available on `TargetFilter` (`TargetFilter.Creature.dealtDamageThisTurn()`).
- `.dealtCombatDamageToSourceControllerThisTurn()` — source-relative: creature dealt combat damage
  *this turn* to the player who controls the effect's source; backed by
  `StatePredicate.DealtCombatDamageToSourceControllerThisTurn`. Resolves `context.sourceId`'s
  controller, so as an edict filter it means "...a creature that dealt combat damage to *you* this
  turn" (Witch-king of Angmar). Per-turn marker, cleared at end-of-turn cleanup; inert with no source
  context (group-static projection returns false).
- `.saddled()` — permanent is saddled (CR 702.171b); backed by `StatePredicate.IsSaddled`.
- `.crewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn()` — source-relative: creature crewed (CR 702.122) or saddled
  (CR 702.171) the effect's source permanent this turn; backed by
  `StatePredicate.CrewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn` (see Object-state predicates). For
  "target/choose/return a creature that crewed/saddled it this turn".
- `.nontoken()` / `.token()` — token vs printed.
- `.monocolored()` — restrict to monocolored objects (exactly one color, CR 105.2); colorless objects don't match. ("for each color among monocolored permanents you control" — Tarnation Vista.)
- `.faceDown()` — face-down state.
- `.card(filter)` — defer to a card-shape filter for off-battlefield checks.

**Explicit constructor**:
`GameObjectFilter(cardPredicates, controllerPredicate, colorPredicate, keywordPredicate, powerToughnessPredicate, subtypePredicate)`.

### `GroupFilter` — static-ability scope

- `GroupFilter.CreaturesYouControl` — your creatures.
- `GroupFilter.CreaturesOpponentControls` — their creatures.
- `GroupFilter.AllCreatures` — every creature on the battlefield.
- `GroupFilter.All(filter)` — custom group.
- Chained: `.withColor`, `.withoutColor`, `.withKeyword`, `.withoutKeyword`, `.withSubtype`, `.withoutSubtype`,
  `.minPower`, `.maxPower`, `.power`.

### Stack-object predicates

These `CardPredicate`s evaluate against entities in the `Zone.STACK` (spells and activated/triggered
abilities on the stack). They are handled in the evaluator before the `CardComponent` check, so they
work for abilities-on-stack (which carry no `CardComponent`).

- `CardPredicate.IsActivatedOrTriggeredAbility` — true for activated/triggered abilities on the stack
  (Stifle).
- `CardPredicate.IsTriggeredAbility` — triggered abilities only (excludes activated abilities and
  spells).
- `CardPredicate.IsActivatedAbility` — activated abilities only (excludes triggered abilities and
  spells). Mana abilities never use the stack, so they're never matched. Exposed as the
  `Targets.ActivatedAbility` target requirement (Bind: "Counter target activated ability").
- `CardPredicate.TargetsMatching(subfilter)` — true when the stack object's `TargetsComponent`
  includes at least one chosen target matching `subfilter`. Player targets are skipped. The
  subfilter inherits the outer `PredicateContext`, so `Land.youControl()` inside the subfilter
  resolves against the outer chooser. Used by Teferi's Response.
- `CardPredicate.HasNonManaActivatedAbility` — matches a permanent whose printed activated abilities
  include at least one that isn't a mana ability and isn't a loyalty ability (battlefield-activatable).
  Backed by the precomputed `CardComponent.hasNonManaActivatedAbility` flag (set at entity creation from
  `CardDefinition.hasNonManaActivatedAbility`), so abilities granted by other continuous effects are not
  counted. Used by Tsabo's Web ("each land with an activated ability that isn't a mana ability …").

### `StatePredicate` — battlefield state checks

- `IsTapped` — currently tapped.
- `IsUntapped` — currently untapped.
- `IsAttacking` — declared as attacker this combat.
- `IsBlocking` — declared as blocker this combat.
- `InSameBandAsSource` (filter builder `inSameBandAsSource()`) — source-relative (CR 702.22):
  matches the effect's source creature itself and any creature sharing its combat band id.
  Resolves against `PredicateContext.sourceId`, so it only matches while that source is attacking
  (band membership exists only during combat). Used as the recipient filter of Camel's
  "prevent all damage Deserts would deal to this creature and to creatures banded with this
  creature". Note: it's only evaluated where the context carries a source entity — currently the
  recipient filter of a `PreventDamage` replacement (see §15); it's inert in group/projection,
  untap, and trigger-gating contexts.
- `IsBlockingSource` (filter builder `blockingSource()`) — source-relative (CR 509): matches a
  creature whose blocked-attacker set contains the effect's `PredicateContext.sourceId`, i.e. the
  source's own blockers. Used with `Patterns.Group.dealDamageToAll(n, GroupFilter(Creature.blockingSource()))`
  for "Whenever this becomes blocked, it deals N damage to each creature blocking it" (Battle-Scarred
  Goblin). Resolves in resolution-time effect contexts (where the source is carried); inert in
  group/projection, untap, and trigger-gating contexts.
- `CrewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn` (filter builder `crewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn()`) —
  source-relative (CR 702.122 / 702.171): matches a creature that crewed or saddled the effect's
  source permanent this turn (i.e. one tapped to pay that permanent's Crew/Saddle cost). Resolves
  against `PredicateContext.sourceId` by reading the source's `CrewSaddleContributorsComponent`;
  inert with no source context (group/projection, untap, trigger-gating). Used for Mount/Vehicle
  payoffs that target/choose/sacrifice/return "a creature that crewed/saddled it this turn" (Giant
  Beaver, Rambling Possum, The Gitrog, Calamity). For the *count* of those creatures use
  `DynamicAmount.CreaturesThatCrewedOrSaddledThisTurn` instead.
- `HasGreatestPower` (filter builder `hasGreatestPower()`) / `HasLeastPower` (filter builder
  `hasLeastPower()`) — has the greatest / least projected power among creatures *its controller*
  controls (ties all qualify). Used for "creature with the greatest/least power" target and edict
  filters, e.g. Witch-king, Bringer of Ruin: `Effects.Sacrifice(Creature.hasLeastPower(), 1, EachOpponent)`.
- `IsRingBearer` (filter builder `ringBearer()`) — the creature is its controller's Ring-bearer
  (CR 701.54: has `RingBearerComponent` and is controlled by its designating owner). Used for
  player-level Ring-bearer conditions via `Conditions.YouControl(Creature.ringBearer(), negate = …)`
  (Dúnedain Rangers: "if you don't control a Ring-bearer"). For the source-relative "this creature is
  your Ring-bearer" use the existing `Conditions.SourceIsRingBearer`.
- `IsFaceDown` — currently face-down.
- `HasCounter(type)` — has at least one counter of `type`.
- `AttachedToCardType(cardType)` — Aura/Equipment whose `AttachedToComponent` points to a
  permanent that currently has the given top-level [`CardType`] in its **projected** type
  set. Used by filters like "Aura attached to a land" (Pyramids) or "Equipment attached
  to a creature". Reads the attached-to permanent's projected types, so a land animated
  into a creature still matches `LAND` and additionally matches `CREATURE`. False for
  entities with no `AttachedToComponent`.
- `IsWarpExiled` (filter builder `warpExiled()`) — card in exile via warp's
  end-of-turn delayed trigger (CR 702.185b).
- `WasCastForWarp` (filter builder `castForWarp()`) — battlefield permanent that
  was cast for its warp cost (CR 702.185). Pair with
  `Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter(GameObjectFilter.Creature.castForWarp(), …)` to
  branch on whether a target was warp-cast (e.g., Full Bore).
- `PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn` (filter builder
  `putIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn()`) — card currently in a graveyard whose most
  recent arrival there was from the battlefield during the current turn. Backed by the
  per-entity `PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurnMarker` data-object component, set by
  `ZoneTransitionService` on every battlefield→graveyard move and stripped when the card
  leaves the graveyard (so a later mill or exile→graveyard arrival doesn't falsely match).
  The marker carries no turn number — `BeginningPhaseManager` wipes it from every entity
  at each turn's untap step, which is what gives the predicate MTG-correct per-turn
  semantics (the engine's `state.turnNumber` increments per round, not per active player,
  so a turn-number comparison would be wrong in multiplayer). Used by Samwise the
  Stouthearted and Lobelia Sackville-Baggins (LTR) — pair with `GameObjectFilter.Permanent`
  or `Creature` on a graveyard-zone `TargetFilter`. False in battlefield-projection / untap /
  trigger-gating contexts (the marker only lives on graveyard cards).
- `BlockedOrWasBlockedByLegendaryThisTurn` (filter builder
  `blockedOrWasBlockedByLegendaryThisTurn()`) — creature that, at some point during the current
  turn, blocked or was blocked by a legendary creature. Backed by the per-creature
  `BlockedOrWasBlockedByLegendaryThisTurnComponent` marker stamped in `BlockPhaseManager` at
  block declaration: the legendary partner's status is captured *at pairing time*, so the
  predicate keeps matching even after that legendary creature leaves the battlefield or loses
  legendary-ness (per the card's ruling). Cleared at end-of-turn cleanup. Distinct from the
  combat-only `IsBlocking`/`IsBlocked`, which only hold during the combat phase. Used by
  You Cannot Pass! (LTR) on a `TargetCreature` filter.

### `AffectsFilter` — static-ability target shapes

- `OtherCreaturesWithSubtype` — lord scope (other creatures of subtype).
- `CreaturesWithCounter` — creatures with at least one counter (Aurification).

> **Load-bearing rule:** filtering battlefield permanents by type/subtype/color/keyword/P-T MUST use
`predicateEvaluator.matchesWithProjection(state, projected, ...)`. Use `projected.isCreature(entityId)` rather than
`cardComponent.typeLine.isCreature`. Non-battlefield zones may read base state.

## 8. Triggered abilities (`Triggers.*`)

`triggeredAbility { trigger; effect; target?; triggerCondition?; optional?; elseEffect?; checkOnNextState?; dealsDamageBeforeResolve?; controlledByTriggeringEntityController?; oncePerTurn?; triggersOnce? }`.

**`oncePerTurn` vs `triggersOnce` — two firing caps.** `oncePerTurn = true` caps the ability to one
fire per turn ("This ability triggers only once each turn", e.g. Scavenger's Talent), tracked by a
per-turn component cleared in cleanup. `triggersOnce = true` is the lifetime cap ("This ability
triggers only once", e.g. Acrobatic Cheerleader): once the source has fired it, it never fires again
while that permanent stays on the battlefield — tracked by a `TriggeredAbilityFiredEverComponent`
that is **not** cleared at end of turn (it lives on the entity, so re-entering the battlefield as a
new object — a distinct game object — triggers afresh). Both caps share one detection-time filter and
collapse simultaneous fires of the same `(source, ability)` to a single instance.

**`optional` + `elseEffect` = "you may [effect]. If you don't, [elseEffect]."** For a **targeted**
trigger, `optional` lets the player choose 0 targets to decline, and `elseEffect` runs on decline or
when no legal targets exist (Entrails Feaster: "you may exile a creature card from a graveyard … if
you don't, tap this"). For a **no-target** trigger the same pair lowers to a
`GatedEffect(Gate.MayDecide, then = effect, otherwise = elseEffect)` resolved by the unified gated
executor — a resolution-time yes/no whose "no" runs `elseEffect`. The may-action's feasibility is
derived from `effect` (a `SacrificeEffect` needs the controller to control a matching permanent), so
an impossible "may" skips the prompt and runs `elseEffect` directly — the no-target analogue of "no
legal targets → else" (Yawgmoth Demon: "you may sacrifice an artifact. If you don't, tap this
creature and it deals 2 damage to you" — with no artifact the tax just applies). Always-feasible
bodies (gain life, draw, add a counter) always prompt.

### Zone change

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for `entersBattlefield(...)` / `leavesBattlefield(...)`
for any other (filter, binding, to/excludeTo) combination.

**Enters the battlefield**

- `EntersBattlefield` — SELF, no filter. ("When this permanent enters.")
- `OtherCreatureEnters` — OTHER binding, filter = `Creature.youControl()`.
- `LandYouControlEnters` — landfall: OTHER binding, filter = `Land.youControl()`.
- `entersBattlefield(filter, binding)` — factory. Covers face-down filters,
  ANY-binding tribal scopes, permanent-you-control scopes, enchantment-enters scopes (Eerie), etc.

**Leaves / dies**

- `LeavesBattlefield` — SELF, any destination.
- `Dies` — SELF, battlefield → graveyard.
- `AnyCreatureDies` — ANY binding, filter = `Creature`.
- `YourCreatureDies` — ANY binding, filter = `Creature.youControl()`. **Per-creature**: fires
  once for *each* matching death, so a board wipe fires it once per creature. Use this for
  "whenever another creature you control dies, …" (Unruly Mob, Rot Shambler, Pitiless Plunderer).
- `OneOrMoreCreaturesYouControlDie(filter = Creature, excludeSelf = false)` — **batched** death
  trigger: fires **at most once per event batch** regardless of how many matching creatures died
  simultaneously. This is the correct shape for "whenever one or more [other] creatures you control
  die, …" (Vengeful Townsfolk) — a per-creature `YourCreatureDies` would over-count on mass removal.
  Set `excludeSelf = true` for the "*other* creatures" wording (the source's own death is excluded).
  Detected specially by `TriggerDetector` (grouped by each dying creature's last-known controller).
  Rule 603.10 "look back in time": if the source itself dies in the *same* batch as another
  qualifying creature, it still sees that death and fires (recovered from its last-known card
  definition, since it has already left the battlefield). For `excludeSelf = true` payoffs that
  target the source (Vengeful Townsfolk's own +1/+1) this is a harmless no-op, but a *non-self*
  payoff — draw a card, make a token, gain life — correctly still resolves on a board wipe that
  also kills the source. The `filter`'s controller predicate scopes which players' deaths count
  (mirrors the enter-batch trigger): no predicate means "you control"; `.opponentControls()` scopes
  to your opponents.
- `OneOrMoreCreaturesAnOpponentControlsDie(filter = Creature)` — the opponent-scoped variant of the
  above (sugar for `OneOrMoreCreaturesYouControlDie(filter.opponentControls())`): batched, fires at
  most once per death batch, so it pairs with `oncePerTurn` without over-firing on mass removal —
  "Whenever one or more creatures your opponents control die, …" (Spiteful Banditry). A per-creature
  `leavesBattlefield(binding = ANY)` would create a separate trigger per death, and simultaneous
  deaths each fire before the once-per-turn marker is set, so the batched form is required here.
- `PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefield` — SELF, same event shape as `Dies`; rename
  clarifies non-creature intent (artifact / enchantment going to yard).
- `leavesBattlefield(filter, to?, excludeTo?, binding)` — factory. `to = GRAVEYARD`
  gives a "dies" variant scoped beyond the named constants (other tribal deaths,
  any-controller deaths); `excludeTo = GRAVEYARD` gives "leaves without dying"
  (Three Tree Scribe shape); leaving both null gives "leaves to any zone."

**Token creation**

- `EventPattern.TokenCreationEvent(controller = ControllerFilter.You, tokenFilter? = null)` — used as
  a trigger, "Whenever you create a token" (Mirkwood Bats). **Per-token**: fires once for *each* token
  created, so an effect that creates three tokens at once fires it three times. Matched against each
  token-creation `ZoneChangeEvent` (`fromZone == null`); a token that's a copy of a permanent spell
  enters from the stack and is **not** "created" (CR 608.3f / 111.13), so it doesn't fire this. The
  same `EventPattern` also serves as a replacement-effect filter (token doublers); the two uses don't
  conflict.

### Combat

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for `attacks(...)` / `blocks(...)` /
`becomesBlocked(...)` for any other combination, and use the [AttackPredicate]
sealed set for attack-time facts beyond the basics.

**Attacks (per-attacker `AttackEvent`)**

- `Attacks` — SELF, no filter. ("When this creature attacks.")
- `attacks(filter?, requires?, binding?)` — factory. Covers ANY-binding scopes,
  type-filtered scopes (creature-you-control, nontoken-creature-you-control),
  and attack-time predicates (alone, future Battalion-style count gates).

**Attacks (player-level)**

- `YouAttack` — when you declare attackers (player-level, ANY binding).
- `YouAttackWithFilter(filter)` — when you attack with ≥1 matching attacker.
- `CreaturesAttackYou` — defender side; fires once per `AttackersDeclaredEvent`,
  not per attacker. Excludes creatures attacking a planeswalker you control
  (CR 509.1b). Pair with `DynamicAmounts.creaturesAttackingYou()` for
  attacker-count payoffs (e.g., Orim's Prayer).

**Blocks**

- `Blocks` — SELF, no filter.
- `BecomesBlocked` — SELF, no filter.
- `blocks(filter?, binding?, attackerFilter?)` — factory. `filter` constrains the
  blocker (ANY binding). `attackerFilter` constrains the blocked attacker — requires
  SELF binding for "whenever this creature blocks a [filter]" (Skystinger);
  combining it with ANY is rejected (the ANY detector branch ignores `attackerFilter`).
  `triggeringEntityId` is set to the blocked attacker in that case.
- `becomesBlocked(filter?, binding?)` — factory. Replaces the old
  `CreatureYouControlBecomesBlocked` and `FilteredBecomesBlocked(filter)`.
- `BlocksOrBecomesBlockedBy(filter, binding = SELF)` — either direction, partner-filtered;
  sole consumer of `BlocksOrBecomesBlockedByEvent`. Prefer `blocks(attackerFilter=...)`
  when only the blocking direction should fire. `binding = ATTACHED` fires off the
  equipped/enchanted creature's combat (Barrow-Blade — "Whenever equipped creature blocks
  or becomes blocked by a creature, …"); the partner is the `TriggeringEntity`.
- `AttacksAndIsntBlocked` — SELF. Fires once per attacker that reaches end of
  Declare Blockers with no creatures declared as blockers (CR 509.3g). Backed by
  `BecomesUnblockedEvent` matched against `BlockersDeclaredEvent`. Used for
  Merchant Ship: "Whenever this creature attacks and isn't blocked, you gain 2 life."
  (SELF only — an ANY-binding filtered variant isn't wired in `TriggerMatcher` yet.)

**`AttackPredicate`** — extensible "facts about an attack declaration."
Adding a new attack-time mechanic is one new sealed-case + one matcher branch
— `AttackEvent` does not grow a new field per axis.

- `AttackPredicate.Alone` — the attacker is the only declared attacker this
  combat (`attacker count == 1`). Replaces the old `alone: Boolean` axis.
- `AttackPredicate.AttackerCountAtLeast(n)` — at least N creatures total were
  declared as attackers (counting the trigger's attacker). Battalion shape:
  `attacks(requires = setOf(AttackerCountAtLeast(3)))` on a `SELF` binding.

Examples:

```kotlin
// "Whenever this creature attacks alone"
Triggers.attacks(requires = setOf(AttackPredicate.Alone))

// "Whenever a nontoken creature you control attacks"
Triggers.attacks(
    filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().nontoken(),
    binding = TriggerBinding.ANY,
)

// "Whenever a Beast becomes blocked"
Triggers.becomesBlocked(
    filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.withSubtype("Beast"),
    binding = TriggerBinding.ANY,
)

// "Whenever this creature blocks a creature with flying" (Skystinger)
Triggers.blocks(attackerFilter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.withKeyword(Keyword.FLYING))
```

`Triggers.BecomesBlocked` (SELF, **unfiltered**) fires **once** when the creature becomes
blocked, regardless of how many creatures block it, with `triggeringEntityId` = the source —
so `DynamicAmounts.numberOfBlockers()` reads this creature's blocker count (Rampage). The
**filtered** SELF form `becomesBlocked(filter = …)` instead fires once per matching blocker,
with `triggeringEntityId` = that blocker (Flanking gives each blocker -1/-1).

### Damage

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for the factories for any other combination of axes.

- `DealsDamage` — source deals any damage (SELF binding).
- `DealsCombatDamageToPlayer` — source deals combat damage to a player (SELF binding).
- `DealsCombatDamageToCreature` — source deals combat damage to a creature (SELF binding).
- `OneOrMoreCreaturesDealCombatDamageToYou(filter = Creature)` — **defensive combat-damage batch trigger** (ANY binding): "whenever one or more creatures deal combat damage to *you*" (Witch-king of Angmar). Fires at most once per combat-damage batch regardless of how many creatures connected with the trigger's controller (the damaged player), unlike per-source `dealsDamage(recipient = You, …)` which fires once per connecting creature. The triggering entity is an arbitrary matching damager. Pair with the `dealtCombatDamageToSourceControllerThisTurn()` filter for "...each opponent sacrifices a creature that dealt combat damage to you this turn".
- `TakesDamage` — source is dealt damage by any source (SELF binding).
- `CreatureDealtDamageByThisDies` — Etali / Sengir / Soul Collector shape (SELF binding): "whenever a creature dealt damage by *this* permanent this turn dies". Uses `CreatureDealtDamageBySourceDiesEvent(sourceFilter = null)`.
- `creatureDealtDamageBySourceDies(sourceFilter)` — observer variant (ANY binding): "whenever another creature dealt damage this turn by [a source matching the filter] dies" (Shelob, Child of Ungoliant: `GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().withSubtype("Spider")`). The damaging source is matched against the filter using last-known info from when it dealt the damage (a `DamagedBySourcesThisTurnComponent` snapshot of the source's controller + subtypes), so a source that died in the same combat still qualifies (CR 608.2h). Only the filter's controller predicate, required subtype, and creature requirement are evaluated against the snapshot.

**Factories** (axes: `damageType` × `recipient` × `sourceFilter` × `binding` for outgoing; `source` × `binding` for incoming):

- `dealsDamage(damageType?, recipient?, sourceFilter?, binding?, requireExcess?)` — outgoing-damage trigger. Pick `DamageType.{Any,Combat,NonCombat}`, `RecipientFilter.{Any,AnyPlayer,AnyPlayerOrPlaneswalker,AnyCreature,…}`, an optional source `GameObjectFilter`, and `TriggerBinding.{SELF,ANY,ATTACHED}`. Covers "deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker", "creature you control deals combat damage to a player" (`binding = ANY` + `sourceFilter = Creature.youControl()`), "nontoken creature you control deals…" (`.nontoken()`), and "enchanted creature deals damage" (`binding = ATTACHED`). Pass `requireExcess = true` to fire only when the recipient was dealt damage past lethal (CR 120.4a) — Fall of Cair Andros' "is dealt excess noncombat damage". Read the excess via `DynamicAmount.ContextProperty(ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_EXCESS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT)`. For a creature recipient, read its toughness *as it last existed at damage time* (CR 603.10 LKI — survives a lethal hit) via `DynamicAmount.ContextProperty(ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_RECIPIENT_TOUGHNESS)`; pair it with a `triggerCondition` such as `Conditions.CompareAmounts(ContextProperty(TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT), ComparisonOperator.EQ, ContextProperty(TRIGGER_RECIPIENT_TOUGHNESS))` for "deals noncombat damage to a creature equal to that creature's toughness" (Taii Wakeen, Perfect Shot). On the observer path (`binding = ANY` + `sourceFilter`), `EntityReference.Triggering` is the damage SOURCE, but the recipient toughness is still carried in this context key. **Combat caveat:** combat-damage state-based actions run *before* trigger detection, so a non-indestructible recipient that dies to the same combat-damage event has already left the battlefield when a `RecipientFilter.CreatureOpponentControls`-style filter reads its `ControllerComponent` — the filter silently fails (no last-known-info path yet). A `requireExcess = true` + `DamageType.Combat` trigger therefore only fires reliably on recipients that survive (indestructible / high toughness). Fall of Cair Andros is unaffected because it gates on `DamageType.NonCombat`, where the trigger is detected from the damage event before the kill SBA.
- `takesDamage(source?, binding?)` — incoming-damage trigger. Pick `SourceFilter.{Any,Creature,Spell,Combat,NonCombat,HasColor(c),…}` and `TriggerBinding.{SELF,ATTACHED}`. Covers "damaged by a creature/spell" and "enchanted creature is dealt damage" (`binding = ATTACHED`, Aurification / Frozen Solid shape).
- `becomesTapped(binding?, filter?)` — "becomes tapped" trigger. `BecomesTapped` is the SELF constant; pass `binding = TriggerBinding.ANY` with an optional `filter: GameObjectFilter` for "whenever a [filter] becomes tapped" (e.g. `GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrLand` — Temporal Distortion). The filter is matched against the tapped permanent via projected state.

### Phase & turn

Named sugar for the common `(step, player)` cases; reach for `phase(step, player?, binding?)`
for anything else (the ATTACHED-binding aura shapes, custom step/player combinations).

- `YourUpkeep` — start of your upkeep.
- `YourDrawStep` — start of your draw step.
- `EachUpkeep` — every upkeep.
- `EachOpponentUpkeep` — at each opponent's upkeep.
- `YourEndStep` — beginning of your end step.
- `EachEndStep` — beginning of each end step.
- `BeginCombat` — start of combat on your turn.
- `EachCombat` — beginning of each combat (any player's turn).
- `FirstMainPhase` — start of pre-combat main.
- `YourPostcombatMain` — start of post-combat main.

**Factory** — `phase(step, player = Player.You, binding = TriggerBinding.ANY)`.

### Aura / equipment

No named constants for the "enchanted/equipped creature does X" shapes — they all collapse to
the existing event factories with `binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED`. Examples (all card uses
in the repo today):

- *Enchanted creature dies* (Demonic Vigor):
  `Triggers.leavesBattlefield(to = Zone.GRAVEYARD, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted/equipped creature leaves the battlefield* (Curator's Ward):
  `Triggers.leavesBattlefield(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted/equipped creature attacks* (Extra Arms, Heart-Piercer Bow, Ordeal of Nylea,
  Chorale of the Void, Atomic Microsizer, Sorcerer Role token):
  `Triggers.attacks(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted permanent becomes tapped* (Uncontrolled Infestation, Cryoshatter):
  `Triggers.becomesTapped(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted creature is turned face up* (Fatal Mutation):
  `Triggers.turnedFaceUp(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *At the beginning of enchanted creature's controller's `<step>`* (Custody Battle,
  Lingering Death): `Triggers.phase(step, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted-creature damage triggers* — damage factories already support binding:
  `Triggers.dealsDamage(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)` (any damage),
  `Triggers.dealsDamage(damageType = Combat, recipient = AnyPlayer, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`,
  `Triggers.takesDamage(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)` (Aurification / Frozen Solid).

### Cards & draws

- `YouDraw` — when you draw a card. Fires once per individual card drawn (CR 121.2), so a
  single "draw N" effect triggers it N times.
- `OpponentDraws` — when an opponent draws a card (once per card; the `Player.EachOpponent` analogue
  of `YouDraw`).
- `OpponentDrawsExceptFirstEachDrawStep` — whenever an opponent draws a card **except** the first
  card they draw in each of their own draw steps (CR 504.1's turn-based draw is exempt; every
  other draw — additional draw-step draws and all draws outside the draw step — fires once per
  card). Backed by `DrawEvent(exceptFirstInDrawStep = true)` plus a per-player draw-step-start
  snapshot (`GameState.drawStepStartDrawCountByPlayer`) that identifies the one exempt card. Used
  by Orcish Bowmasters / A-Orcish Bowmasters.
- `NthCardDrawn(n, player?)` — fires when the drawing player draws their Nth card each turn
  (CR 121.2). Draw analogue of `NthSpellCast`; backed by `CardsDrawnThisTurnComponent` (reset
  per turn). Fires exactly once per crossing — a single multi-card draw that spans the
  threshold triggers it once, not N times. Putting cards into hand without "draw" (CR 121.5)
  does not advance the count. Used by Knights of Dol Amroth, Prince Imrahil the Fair,
  Stalwarts of Osgiliath ("Whenever you draw your second card each turn, …").
- `RevealCreatureFromDraw` — Hatching Plans-style top-card reveal.
- `RevealCardFromDraw` — generic reveal-from-draw trigger.
- `CardsPutIntoYourGraveyard(filter?)` — when matching cards enter your yard.
- `PermanentCardsPutIntoYourGraveyard` — only permanent cards.
- `CreaturesPutIntoGraveyardFromLibrary` — mill-trigger shape.
- `CardsLeaveYourGraveyard(filter?)` — batching trigger; fires once per event batch when one
  or more matching cards **leave** your graveyard (cast/exiled/reanimated/returned to hand,
  etc.), regardless of how many or where they went. For the common "leave your graveyard
  **during your turn**" wording, add `triggerCondition = Conditions.IsYourTurn`; for "this
  ability triggers only once each turn", add `oncePerTurn = true`. (Attuned Hunter, Kishla
  Skimmer, Kheru Goldkeeper.)

### Discard

Fires once per card discarded — a single resolution that discards N cards fires the
trigger N times (mirrors how `YouDraw` handles multi-card draws). The engine emits
one aggregate `CardsDiscardedEvent` per resolution and fans it out in the detector.
`Player.TriggeringPlayer` resolves to the discarding player inside the effect.

- `AnyOpponentDiscards` — whenever an opponent discards a card. (Entropic Battlecruiser.)
- `YouDiscard` — whenever you discard a card.

**Factory** — `discards(player?, cardFilter?)` — generic shape. `player = Player.Each`
matches any player; `cardFilter` narrows the fan-out to matching cards, so a batch that
discards a creature and two lands fires a `cardFilter = Creature` trigger once, not three
times. The cardFilter is evaluated against the **post-discard zone** (the cards are already
in the graveyard when the trigger matches) — safe for type/subtype/color predicates,
but a filter that depends on hand-specific state would read the wrong zone.

### Spell casting

Named sugar for the common type-primitive cases; reach for `youCastSpell(...)` plus a
`SpellCastPredicate` set for anything from-zone / kicked / mana-source-tagged.

- `YouCastSpell` — any spell you cast.
- `YouCastCreature` — any creature spell you cast.
- `YouCastNoncreature` — non-creature spells you cast.
- `YouCastInstantOrSorcery` — instant/sorcery you cast.
- `YouCastEnchantment` — any enchantment you cast.
- `YouCastHistoric` — artifact / legendary / Saga.
- `YouCastSubtype(subtype)` — tribal helper: spell with matching subtype.
- `AnySpellOrAbilityOnStack` — any object hits the stack.
- `OpponentActivatesAbility` — an opponent activates an ability that **isn't a mana ability** (CR 605/606). Mana
  abilities don't use the stack, so they never fire this; loyalty abilities (which are activated abilities) do. Pair
  with `Effects.DealDamage(n, EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.TriggeringPlayer))` to punish the activator (Flamescroll
  Celebrant). Backed by `EventPattern.AbilityActivatedEvent(player)`.
- `YouActivateAbility` — you activate an ability that isn't a mana ability (the `Player.You` form of the above).
- `youActivateAbilityTargeting(targetMatch)` — you activate an ability whose **chosen targets** satisfy
  `targetMatch`. Backed by `EventPattern.AbilityActivatedEvent(player, targetMatch)`: when `targetMatch != null`, the
  activated ability on the stack must have at least one chosen target matching it, so a non-targeting ability (e.g.
  tap-for-mana) never fires. `targetMatch` is an `AbilityTargetMatch` (in `scripting.events`): `ObjectMatching(filter)`
  matches an object target against a `GameObjectFilter`, `AnyPlayer` matches a player target, and `AnyOf(list)` is a
  heterogeneous OR (the match space is wider than `GameObjectFilter` because an ability can target a player too).
  `AbilityTargetMatch.CreatureOrPlayer` is the prebuilt "targets a creature or player" used by Ertha Jo, Frontier
  Mentor, whose payoff is `Effects.CopyTargetSpellOrAbility(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity)` (for an
  `AbilityActivatedEvent` the triggering entity is the activated ability on the stack; the copy executor reprompts for
  new targets, CR 707.10/707.10c).

**Other casters.** The same shape, scoped to a different caster via the runtime
`Player.Each` / `Player.EachOpponent` matching on `SpellCastEvent`. Bind the payoff to the
caster with `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.TriggeringPlayer)`.

- `AnyPlayerCastsSpell` — any player (including you) casts a spell.
- `OpponentCastsSpell` — an opponent casts a spell.
- `AnyPlayerChoosesTargets` — any player casts a spell, activates an ability, or puts a triggered ability on the stack with ≥1 target (fires once per object via `EventPattern.TargetsChosenEvent`). The triggering entity is that spell/ability, so the payoff can read/change its targets (Psychic Battle).
- `anyPlayerCasts(spellFilter?, requires?)` — factory; e.g. `anyPlayerCasts(GameObjectFilter.Creature)`
  for "whenever a player casts a creature spell" (Pure Reflection).
- `opponentCasts(spellFilter?, requires?)` — factory; e.g. `opponentCasts(GameObjectFilter.Multicolored)`
  for "whenever an opponent casts a multicolored spell" (Rewards of Diversity).
- `youCastSpellTargetingSource()` — "whenever you cast a spell that targets [this permanent]"
  (Legolas, Master Archer). Sugar for `youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.TargetsSource))`.
- `youCastSpellTargeting(filter)` — "whenever you cast a spell that targets a [filter]" (Legolas,
  Master Archer's `Creature.opponentControls()`). Sugar for
  `youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.TargetsMatching(filter)))`.

**Factory** — `youCastSpell(spellFilter?, requires: Set<SpellCastPredicate>)`. The
`requires` set is conjunctive — every predicate must hold for the trigger to fire.

**`SpellCastPredicate`** — extensible "facts about a cast." Adding a new cast-time mechanic
(was-copied, was-overloaded, paid-additional-life-cost, …) is one new sealed-case plus one
matcher branch — `SpellCastEvent` does not grow a new field per axis.

- `SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(zone)` — spell was cast from this zone. Used for Sunbird's
  Invocation (`Zone.HAND`), Goliath Daydreamer's instant/sorcery-from-hand trigger,
  Wildsear's enchantment-from-hand cascade.
- `SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZoneOtherThan(zone)` — the negation: spell was cast from a known
  zone that is *not* [zone]. Fires only on an actual cast from a different recorded zone (a spell
  with no recorded cast zone does not satisfy it). Used by Kellan, the Kid — "Whenever you cast a
  spell from anywhere other than your hand" (`CastFromZoneOtherThan(Zone.HAND)`): casts from
  exile (Adventure / plotted), graveyard (flashback), or the top of library all match; hand casts
  don't.
- `SpellCastPredicate.WasKicked` — spell was cast with kicker (CR 702.32). Used for
  Hallar / Bloodstone Goblin.
- `SpellCastPredicate.PaidWithManaFromSubtype(subtype)` — mana from a permanent of this
  subtype was spent on the cast. Resolves Treasure today (Rain of Riches, Alchemist's
  Talent); engine matcher accepts other token subtypes as the shape, but only Treasure
  actually fires until the mana-pool tracker generalizes beyond its current Treasure-only
  boolean.
- `SpellCastPredicate.IsModal` — spell was cast with at least one chosen mode (rules
  700.2). Matches `SpellCastEvent.chosenModesCount > 0`, where the count is the size of
  `SpellOnStackComponent.chosenModes` (so Spree picking the same mode twice counts as
  two). Used by Riku of Many Paths: "Whenever you cast a modal spell, …".
- `SpellCastPredicate.HasXInCost` — spell has `{X}` in its printed mana cost (CR 107.3).
  A property of the cost, not the value chosen, so a spell cast with X=0 still satisfies
  it. Matches `CardComponent.manaCost.hasX`. Read the announced X in the payoff via
  `DynamicAmounts.xValueOfTriggeringSpell()` (→ `ContextPropertyKey.X_VALUE_OF_TRIGGERING_SPELL`).
  Used by Geometer's Arthropod: "Whenever you cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, look
  at the top X cards of your library, …".
- `SpellCastPredicate.TargetsSource` — the cast spell targets the trigger's own source
  permanent. Used by Legolas, Master Archer ("a spell that targets Legolas").
- `SpellCastPredicate.TargetsMatching(filter)` — the cast spell has ≥1 chosen target matching
  `filter` (evaluated relative to the trigger controller). Used by Legolas, Master Archer
  ("a spell that targets a creature you don't control").
- `SpellCastPredicate.NotOwnedByController` — the cast spell is owned by someone other than its
  controller (the trigger's controller, i.e. "you"). True precisely for "a spell you don't own":
  a card you cast out of exile / a graveyard that belongs to another player (Nita, Forum
  Conciliator; Gonti's-style borrow effects). Matches when the spell entity's `OwnerComponent`
  (fixed at game start, CR 108.3) differs from the controller; a spell cast from your own zones
  (owner == controller) never satisfies it.

Examples:

```kotlin
// "Whenever you cast a spell from your hand"
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(Zone.HAND)))

// "Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery from your hand"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.InstantOrSorcery,
    requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(Zone.HAND)),
)

// "Whenever you cast a kicked spell"
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.WasKicked))

// "Whenever you cast a spell using mana from a Treasure"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.PaidWithManaFromSubtype(Subtype.TREASURE)),
)

// "Whenever you cast a modal spell" (Riku of Many Paths)
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.IsModal))

// "Whenever you cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost" (Geometer's Arthropod) —
// then dig X cards: keep one, bottom the rest in a random order.
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.HasXInCost))
// payoff count: DynamicAmounts.xValueOfTriggeringSpell()

// "Whenever you cast a noncreature or Otter spell"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.Noncreature or
                  GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(Subtype("Otter")),
)
```

### State change & misc

- `TurnedFaceUp` — source turns face up. Use `turnedFaceUp(binding)` for the ATTACHED-binding aura variant (Fatal Mutation).
- `CreatureTurnedFaceUp(player?)` — when a creature you control turns face up.
- `GainControlOfSelf` — you gain control of source.
- `BecomesTarget(filter?)` — source becomes target of spell/ability. The engine emits the
  underlying `BecomesTargetEvent` for both permanent targets and spell targets on the stack, but the
  trigger matches **permanent targets only** by default — "a creature you control" is a battlefield
  creature, not a creature spell. Set `includeSpellTargets = true` on the event for the "... or a
  creature spell you control" wording (Surrak, Elusive Hunter); the `filter` is then also matched
  against the spell's card data, so a `Creature` filter matches a creature spell on the stack. Ward
  never sees spell targets because it is generated only from battlefield permanents.
- `CreatureYouControlBecomesTargetByOpponent(filter?, includeSpellTargets = false)` — your creature
  gets targeted by an opponent's spell or ability. Permanent-only unless `includeSpellTargets = true`
  (Surrak), which also fires when an opponent targets a matching creature spell you control.
- `BecomesTargetByOpponent` — the self-bound counterpart of the above: source becomes the target of a
  spell or ability **an opponent controls** (Cactarantula's "Whenever this creature becomes the target
  of a spell or ability an opponent controls, you may draw a card").
- `BecomesTargetOfSpell(filter)` — a permanent matching `filter` becomes the target of a **spell**
  only (not an ability). Sets `BecomesTargetEvent(spellsOnly = true)`, which matches only when the
  targeting source is a spell on the stack (`sourceIsSpell`). ANY-bound; a filter like "a Spirit you
  control" covers both halves of "King of the Oathbreakers or another Spirit you control becomes the
  target of a spell" because the source itself matches the filter. Pair with
  `Effects.PhaseOut(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity)` to phase out the targeted permanent.
- `PhasesIn(filter?)` — a permanent matching `filter` phases in (Rule 702.26). Matches the engine's
  `PhasedInEvent`, which `BeginningPhaseManager.performUntapStep` emits when a phased-out permanent
  returns during its controller's untap step. ANY-bound (use the filter, e.g. "a Spirit you control",
  for "King of the Oathbreakers or another Spirit you control phases in"); `TriggeringEntity` resolves
  to the phased-in permanent. King of the Oathbreakers makes a tapped token on each phase-in.
- `Transforms` — source transforms (either direction).
- `TransformsToFront` — to front face.
- `TransformsToBack` — to back face.
- `YouCycleThis` — you cycle source.
- `AnyPlayerCycles` — anyone cycles.
- `AnyPlayerTapsLandForMana` — whenever any player taps a land for mana. Use
  `landTappedForMana(player, landFilter, binding)` for "an opponent"/"you" variants or a land-type
  restriction. Fires on the manual mana-ability path only (auto-pay adds mana via the solver without
  emitting the event). Backs the "whenever a player taps a land for mana" family (Mana Flare, Heartbeat
  of Spring); the inline-static cards (Overabundance, Pulse) use the mana statics in §9 instead.
- `YouCommitCrime` — MKM crime mechanic.
- `YouGiveAGift` — Gift mechanic.
- `BecomesPlotted` — OTJ Plot (CR 718) — "when this card becomes plotted". SELF binding; fires for the
  very card that was plotted while it sits face up in exile (Aloe Alchemist). Detected by
  `TriggerDetector.detectPlottedCardTriggers` off the plot special action's `CardPlottedEvent`, since
  the card is never on the battlefield for the index loop to see.
- `becomesSaddled(filter = Any, firstTimeEachTurn = false, binding = SELF)` — OTJ Saddle (CR 702.171b)
  — "whenever this creature becomes saddled". Fires when a Saddle ability resolves on the permanent
  (`BecameSaddledEvent`); the Mount stays on the battlefield while saddled, so it matches in the regular
  battlefield index loop (`TriggerCategory.BECAME_SADDLED`). Pass `firstTimeEachTurn = true` for the
  "for the first time each turn" intervening-if (Stubborn Burrowfiend) — backed by the event's
  `firstThisTurn` flag, which is true only when the permanent wasn't already saddled when the ability
  resolved (re-saddling in the same turn reports false, since `SaddledComponent` persists until
  cleanup). Use an `ANY` binding + `filter` for "whenever a [filter] becomes saddled".
- `becomesAttached(attachmentFilter = Any, attachmentController = Any, attachedToFilter = Any, binding = SELF)`
  — "whenever an Aura/Equipment becomes attached to a permanent" (CR 603.2e). Fires from
  `PermanentAttachedEvent`, emitted at every attach site (aura ETB onto its enchant target, equip
  resolution, an aura moved onto the battlefield attached by an effect) only when newly attached —
  not on a persisting attachment, and not on phasing in/out (CR 702.26j). The triggering entity is
  the **attachment**; the host it attached to is reachable via
  `EffectTarget.AttachedToTriggeringPermanent`. `SELF` = "whenever **this** Equipment/Aura becomes
  attached" (Assimilation Aegis). `ANY` + `attachmentController = Player.You` + `attachmentFilter`
  = "whenever a [filter] you control becomes attached to …" (Eriette, the Beguiler); the
  `attachedToFilter` is matched against the host with the attaching object exposed as
  `EntityReference.Triggering`, so relative predicates like
  `manaValueAtMostEntity(EntityReference.Triggering)` ("MV ≤ that Aura's MV") resolve against it.
  Indexed under `TriggerCategory.BECOMES_ATTACHED`.
- `Valiant` — Bloomburrow Valiant trigger.
- `RoomFullyUnlocked` — Rooms — both doors unlocked.
- `OnDoorUnlocked` — single Room door unlocked.

### Life

- `YouGainLife` — you gain any life.
- `YouGainLifeFirstTimeEachTurn` — you gain life for the first time each turn (Leech Collector). Backed by `LifeGainEvent(firstTimeEachTurn = true)`, matched against `LifeChangedEvent.firstThisTurn` (computed in `DamageUtils.gainLife` before the per-turn life-gained marker is set).
- `AnyPlayerGainsLife` — anyone gains life.
- `YouLoseLife` — you lose any life.
- `AnyPlayerLosesLife` — anyone loses life.
- `YouGainOrLoseLife` — combined life-change.

### The Ring

- `RingTemptsYou` — whenever the Ring tempts you (CR 701.54d). Paired with `Effects.TheRingTemptsYou()`.
- `WheneverYouChooseRingBearer` — whenever you choose a creature as your Ring-bearer (CR 701.54a–b).
  A `RingTemptedEvent` pattern with `requireBearerChosen = true`, so it fires only when the temptation
  actually designates a creature (the event's `bearerId` is non-null) — not when you control none to
  choose. Used by Call of the Ring.

### Scry

- `WheneverYouScry` — fires once per scry resolution (CR 701.18), after the cards have
  been placed on top/bottom. Pair with `DynamicAmount.ContextProperty(ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_SCRY_COUNT)`
  for "for each card looked at" payoffs (Celeborn the Wise, Elrond Master of Healing).
  Automatically emitted by `Patterns.Library.scry(N)`; no card has to opt in.

### Saga chapter resolution (CR 714)

- `WheneverFinalChapterOfYourSagaResolves` — fires when the *final* chapter ability of a Saga you
  control finishes resolving (Tom Bombadil). The engine detects Saga chapter abilities from
  lore-counter additions, marks them, and emits `SagaChapterResolvedEvent` on resolution; this
  trigger matches the ones flagged as the final chapter. Pair with `oncePerTurn = true` for "This
  ability triggers only once each turn."
- `WheneverChapterOfYourSagaResolves` — same, but matches *any* chapter ability's resolution
  (`finalChapterOnly = false`).

### Sacrifice & counters

- `YouSacrificeOneOrMore(filter?)` — you sac ≥1 matching. Built with `binding = ANY`, which (CR-faithfully)
  **includes the source sacrificing itself**: an ANY-binding sacrifice-batch trigger fires both when *another*
  matching permanent is sacrificed and when the source permanent is itself sacrificed. The triggering entity is
  bound to the just-sacrificed permanent, so a payoff reading "that <permanent>" (its mana value / a token copy
  of it) resolves against its last-known information in the graveyard. This is exactly the wording "whenever you
  sacrifice this permanent or another <filter>" (Esoteric Duplicator) as well as the plain "whenever you sacrifice
  a <filter>" (Mayhem Devil). For the "another" exclusion use an `OTHER`-binding trigger instead.
- `Sacrificed` — source is sacrificed.
- `PlusOneCountersPlacedOnYourCreature` — Hardened Scales shape (+1/+1 only).
- `countersPlacedOn(filter = Creature.youControl(), counterType = Counters.ANY, firstTimeEachTurn = true, binding = ANY)`
  — fires when counters of any type (`Counters.ANY` wildcard) land on a matching permanent;
  `firstTimeEachTurn` gates it to the first counter placement on *that* permanent this turn
  (engine-tracked via `ReceivedCountersThisTurnComponent`). `binding = SELF` restricts it to the
  source permanent (the `TriggerMatcher.CountersPlacedEvent` branch honors `SELF`/`OTHER`).
  Triggering permanent is `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`. Stalwart Successor shape.
- `CountersPlacedOnThis` — "whenever you put one or more counters on ~" (any kind, SELF-bound).
  Aragorn, Company Leader.
- `OneOrMorePermanentsEnter(filter?)` — batched ETB trigger; fires at most once per event batch
  (CR 603.3b). The `filter`'s controller predicate scopes which players' permanents count: no
  predicate means "you control" (default), `.opponentControls()` scopes to your opponents. The
  matching members of the batch are exposed to the payoff as the pipeline collection
  `PipelineState.TRIGGER_CAPTURED_COLLECTION` — iterate them with
  `ForEachInCollectionEffect(PipelineState.TRIGGER_CAPTURED_COLLECTION, body)` where the body uses
  `EffectTarget.Self` for the current entered permanent ("for each of them, create a tapped copy of
  it" — Kambal, Profiteering Mayor).
- `OneOrMoreOpponentPermanentsEnter(filter?)` — same batched ETB trigger with the controller scope
  fixed to your opponents (sugar for `OneOrMorePermanentsEnter(filter.opponentControls())`).
- `OneOrMoreLeaveWithoutDying(...)` — batched LTB-without-dying.

### Conditional

- `NthSpellCast(n, player?)` — fires on the Nth spell cast.
- `WhenYouCastThisSpell()` — a "cast trigger" that fires on the spell's **own** cast while it is on
  the stack (`EventPattern.CastThisSpellEvent`, `binding = SELF`). Distinct from a battlefield
  `SpellCast`/`NthSpellCast` trigger that observes *other* spells: this one travels with the spell
  onto the stack and is detected only by `TriggerDetector`'s self-cast path (it is deliberately
  **not** indexed against battlefield permanents, so it never fires after the spell resolves).
  Pair with a `triggerCondition` for an intervening "if" (CR 603.4). Sage of the Skies — "When you
  cast this spell, if you've cast another spell this turn, copy this spell" — uses
  `triggerCondition = Conditions.YouCastSpellsThisTurn(atLeast = 2)` (the spell itself is already
  counted, so "two or more" = "another spell") and `Effects.CopyTargetSpell(TriggeringEntity)` to
  copy itself; copying a permanent spell yields a token (CR 707.10f), and the copy isn't cast so it
  doesn't re-trigger (CR 707.10).
- `Expend(threshold)` — Expend N (CLB mechanic).

### Delayed & granted triggers

- `DelayedTriggeredAbility` — registered now, fires at a specific future step (Astral Slide).
- `Effects.GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect` — grant a triggered ability for a duration; `GrantTriggeredAbilityExecutor` uses
  projected state and supports leaves-battlefield-to-zone triggers.
- `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step, effect, fireOnPlayer, timing, …)` —
  the data-side facade. Two orthogonal axes control *whose / which* turn fires the trigger:
  - `fireOnPlayer: EffectTarget?` — the single "whose turn" gate. Resolved to a concrete player
    at scheduling time; only matches when that player is active. Defaults to `null` (no player
    gate — fires on the next matching step of *any* turn). Two common shapes:
    - `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.You)` — only the controller's turn ("at the beginning of
      *your* next end step"; Dragonhawk, Kav Landseeker, Meandering Towershell).
    - `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.TriggeringPlayer)` — the triggering/damaged player's turn
      ("at the beginning of *their* next [step]"; Nafs Asp's "that player loses 1 life at the
      beginning of their next draw step unless they pay {1}").
    The resolved player id is also re-exposed to the inner `effect` as `triggeringPlayerId` /
    `triggeringEntityId` when the trigger fires, so `Player.TriggeringPlayer` inside the inner
    effect resolves to the same player.
  - `timing: DelayedTriggerTiming` — gates *which* turn is the earliest eligible one:
    - `CURRENT_TURN_OR_LATER` (default) — no turn floor; the next upcoming occurrence of `step`,
      which may be the current turn. (Astral Slide exile-until-end-step.)
    - `NEXT_END_STEP` — "at the beginning of your next end step": defers to next turn only if the
      controller's current-turn end step has already begun (END/CLEANUP); otherwise the current
      turn's end step qualifies. (Dragonhawk, Fate's Tempest.)
    - `NEXT_TURN` — stricter "on your next turn"-style timing: the current turn never qualifies
      regardless of step. Pair with `fireOnPlayer = PlayerRef(Player.You)` to land on the
      controller's upcoming own turn rather than an intervening opponent turn. (Kav Landseeker.)
- **Event-based delayed triggers** — pass `trigger = <TriggerSpec>` (instead of `step`) and the
  delayed ability fires whenever a matching *event* occurs, staying resident until `expiry`
  (`DelayedTriggerExpiry.EndOfTurn`) removes it. Supported events include `DealsDamageEvent`,
  `ZoneChangeEvent`, the internal `DamagePreventedEvent`, and the attack-declaration events
  `YouAttackEvent` / `AttackEvent`. There are two ways to scope which events match:
  - **Entity-scoped** — set `watchedTarget` to bind the trigger to one concrete entity (resolved at
    creation time): "when **that** creature deals combat damage / dies this turn" (Long River Lurker,
    Deflecting Palm). Only `DealsDamageEvent` (scoped on the damage source) and `ZoneChangeEvent`
    (scoped on the moving entity) use this; the spec's `GameObjectFilter` is *not* applied — the
    watched entity is the whole scope.
  - **Recipient-scoped** — set `watchedRecipient` to bind a `DealsDamageEvent` trigger to the damaged
    *recipient* (rather than the source): "whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to
    **that player** this turn, …" (Great Train Heist's Treasure-on-hit mode). The target is resolved at
    creation time (e.g. `EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0)` for a just-chosen target opponent), so the
    trigger fires only for hits to that specific player. The `TriggerSpec`'s `recipient` / `sourceFilter`
    still apply on top (use `RecipientFilter.AnyPlayer` + `sourceFilter = Creature.youControl()`).
    Orthogonal to `watchedTarget` (source scope) — set at most one.
  - **Filter-scoped** — leave `watchedTarget` null and let the `TriggerSpec`'s `GameObjectFilter` +
    `TriggerBinding` describe the group, exactly like a battlefield-resident trigger. Use this for
    "whenever a creature you control enters this turn, …" (Thunder of Unity chapters II/III):
    `trigger = Triggers.entersBattlefield(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl(), binding = ANY)`.
    Matching delegates to the same `TriggerMatcher` the battlefield triggers use, so the filter's
    type **and** controller predicates are honored — it fires only for *your* creatures, not every
    permanent that enters. (`YouAttackEvent` / `AttackEvent` are always filter-scoped this way.)
  - `fireOnce = true` makes it a **one-shot**: it's consumed the first time it fires, then gone —
    "when you **next** [event] this turn". Combine with `trigger = Triggers.YouAttack` for the
    common "when you next attack this turn, …" template (All-Out Assault: untap each creature you
    control on your next attack). With `fireOnce = false` (default) it fires on every matching event
    until expiry (double-strike combat damage). One-shot consumption happens when the trigger goes
    on the stack (`TriggerProcessor`), so a second matching event the same turn won't re-fire it.
  - `targetRequirement = <TargetRequirement>` — a target chosen **each time** the delayed trigger
    fires, exposed to `effect` as `EffectTarget.ContextTarget`. Use for delayed triggers whose payoff
    targets: Rediscover the Way chapter III installs
    `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(trigger = Triggers.YouCastNoncreature, fireOnce = false,
    expiry = EndOfTurn, targetRequirement = Targets.CreatureYouControl,
    effect = Effects.GrantKeyword(Keyword.DOUBLE_STRIKE))` — "whenever you cast a noncreature spell
    this turn, target creature you control gains double strike". Works on both event-based and
    step-based delayed triggers; null (default) for non-targeting delayed triggers.
  - **Amount snapshot at creation time.** When `effect` is an `AddManaEffect` / `AddColorlessManaEffect`
    carrying a non-`Fixed` `DynamicAmount` that reads from the *current* resolution context — e.g.
    `DynamicAmounts.targetManaSpent(0)` (`EntityProperty(Target(0), ManaSpent)`) — the executor
    evaluates that amount **now** and bakes it into a `DynamicAmount.Fixed` literal, exactly as it
    bakes `ContextTarget(n)` target references into `SpecificEntity`. This is required for "at the
    beginning of your next main phase, add an amount of {C} equal to the amount of mana spent to cast
    that spell" (**Mana Sculpt**): the referenced spell is gone by the time the delayed trigger fires,
    so a lazy read would yield 0 — author the gated delayed-trigger creation *before* the counter so
    the target spell is still on the stack when the snapshot is taken. Already-`Fixed` amounts pass
    through untouched.
  - **Context-target baking covers `CreateTokenCopyOfTargetEffect`.** A delayed "at the beginning of the
    next end step, create a token that's a copy of that <permanent>" whose `target` is `TriggeringEntity` /
    `ContextTarget(n)` / `Self` is baked into a `SpecificEntity` at creation time (same mechanism that bakes
    `MoveToZoneEffect` / `SacrificeTargetEffect` / `AddCountersEffect` targets). The copied permanent is
    typically gone (sacrificed → graveyard) by the time the trigger fires; the token-copy executor then reads
    its printed characteristics from the captured entity's `CardComponent` via last-known information. Used by
    **Esoteric Duplicator** ("whenever you sacrifice this artifact or another artifact … create a token that's a
    copy of that artifact").

## 8.5 State-triggered abilities (CR 603.8)

A **state-triggered ability** fires whenever a game-state condition becomes true, rather
than in response to a `GameEvent`. The engine polls the condition at every priority pass
and emits the trigger on each false → true transition. Once it has fired, a per-permanent
`StateTriggerLatchesComponent` latch suppresses re-firing until the condition next
evaluates false again (CR 603.8).

> **Latch note.** The printed CR 603.8 resets after the ability *leaves the stack* and
> re-triggers if the condition is still true. This engine resets on the condition next
> being *false* instead — equivalent for "sacrifice this creature" cards (source leaves,
> condition clears) but divergent for a state trigger that leaves source and condition
> intact. No such card exists yet; reset-on-leaves-the-stack should be wired before one is
> authored.

```kotlin
stateTriggeredAbility {
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(
        GameObjectFilter.Land.withSubtype("Island"),
        negate = true,
    )
    effect = Effects.SacrificeTarget(EffectTarget.Self)
    description = "When you control no Islands, sacrifice this creature"
}
```

- `condition` — any `Condition`. Evaluated with the source permanent as
  `EffectContext.sourceId`; `Player.You` references resolve to the source's controller.
- `effect` — fires when the condition transitions false → true. Resolves on the stack
  like an ordinary triggered ability.
- `description` (optional) — overrides the auto-generated text.

Used for Dandân, Island Fish Jasconius, Merchant Ship ("When you control no Islands,
sacrifice this creature"), Serendib Djinn ("When you control no lands, sacrifice this
creature"), and similar "static cleanup" wording in early sets. Differs from an
intervening-if triggered ability — there is no event to gate on; the engine watches the
condition itself.

---

## 9. Static abilities

```kotlin
staticAbility {
    // The whole continuous modification is the `ability`; the affected objects (filter),
    // layer, and duration all live on the StaticAbility itself, not on the block.
    ability = GrantKeyword(
        Keyword.FLYING,
        GroupFilter.CreaturesYouControl.withSubtype("Soldier")
    )
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(Filters.Swamp)   // optional intervening condition
}
```

> A static ability is a continuous modification, so `ability = <StaticAbility>` is the only
> path — there is no `effect =` shorthand. For a permanent that grants several modifications,
> use one `staticAbility { }` block per `StaticAbility` (e.g. an Equipment that gives +2/+1 and
> trample is two blocks).

**`Modification` options**

- `AddSubtype(subtype)` — add a subtype to matching creatures.
- `RemoveSubtype(subtype)` — strip a subtype.
- `ReplaceSubtypes(subtypes)` — set the subtype list outright.
- `ModifyStats(p, t)` — `±P/±T`.
- `SetPower(p)` — overwrite power.
- `SetToughness(t)` — overwrite toughness.
- `SetStats(p, t)` — overwrite both.
- `GrantKeyword(keyword)` — grant a keyword.
- `RemoveKeyword(keyword)` — remove a keyword.
- `GrantProtection(color)` — grant protection from a color.
- `Custom(...)` — escape hatch for one-off modifications.

**Composite static abilities**

- `ModifyStatsForCreatureGroup` — lord-style P/T booster targeting a group.
- `SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic(power, toughness, filter = GroupFilter.source())` —
  characteristic-defining ability (CDA): *sets* base power and toughness each to a `DynamicAmount`,
  recomputed continuously at projection (Layer 7b SET_VALUES). Distinct from
  `GrantDynamicStatsEffect`, which is a Layer 7c additive *bonus*: use this when the dynamic value
  *is* the printed base P/T (a later base-setting effect overwrites it rather than stacking). For
  `*/*` creatures and token CDAs — e.g. Beau ("power and toughness each equal to the number of lands
  you control"), Tarmogoyf-style stats. Pair with `DynamicAmounts.landsYouControl()` /
  `AggregateBattlefield(...)`. (Bonny Pall, Clearcutter's Beau token)
- `GrantKeywordByCounter` — Aurification — keyword based on counters present.
- `AddCreatureTypeByCounter` — subtype based on counters present.
- `SetEnchantedLandType(landType)` — "Enchanted land is an Island" — replaces the enchanted
  land's basic land types with a fixed type (Rule 305.7). (Sea's Claim)
- `SetEnchantedLandTypeFromChosen` — "Enchanted land is the chosen type" — same, but reads the
  type from the source's `ChosenLandTypeComponent` (paired with
  `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE)`). Chosen-value counterpart to
  `SetEnchantedLandType`, mirroring `GrantChosenColor`/`GrantColor`. (Phantasmal Terrain)
- `GrantLandwalkOfChosenType(filter = attachedCreature())` — "Enchanted creature has landwalk of
  the chosen type" — grants the landwalk keyword matching the source's `ChosenLandTypeComponent`
  (Plains→Plainswalk, Island→Islandwalk, …) at projection time. Chosen-value counterpart to
  `GrantKeyword`; pair with `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE)`. (Traveler's Cloak)
- `GrantProtectionFromControlledColors(filter = attachedCreature())` — "[filter] have protection from
  the colors of permanents you control" — grants the affected creature(s) protection from every color
  among the permanents the source's controller controls, recomputed at projection (Layer 6, after
  Layer 5 colors) so it tracks the board in real time. Colorless permanents add no color. (Pledge of
  Loyalty)
- `GrantProtectionFromCardType(cardType, filter = attachedCreature())` — "[filter] have protection from
  [card type]s" (e.g. *protection from instants*, *protection from sorceries*). Projects the keyword
  `PROTECTION_FROM_CARDTYPE_<TYPE>`; the engine enforces the *targeting* leg (a spell/permanent of that
  card type can't target the creature), which is the only DEBT leg that matters for instants/sorceries.
  Pair two of these for the two-type wording. (Sword of Wealth and Power)
- `GrantHexproofFromMonocoloredToGroup(filter = attachedCreature())` — "[filter] have hexproof from
  monocolored" — adds the projected keyword `HEXPROOF_FROM_MONOCOLORED`, which blocks targeting by
  monocolored (exactly one color, CR 105.2) spells and abilities opponents control. Colorless and
  multicolored sources are unaffected; the controller can still target their own creatures. (Dragonfire
  Blade)
- `GrantCardType(cardType, filter)` / `RemoveCardType(cardType, filter)` — Layer 4 type-changing statics that add or
  remove a card type (e.g. `"CREATURE"`). `RemoveCardType` backs Impending's "isn't a creature while it has a time
  counter" (wrapped in a `ConditionalStaticAbility`); reuse it for any "it's no longer a [type]" effect.
- `ConditionalStaticAbility` — static gated by a runtime `Condition`.
- `CantReceiveCounters(filter)` — matching permanents can't have counters put on them (projects the
  `AbilityFlag.CANT_RECEIVE_COUNTERS` flag).
- `CantBeSacrificed(filter)` — matching permanents can't be sacrificed (projects the
  `AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_SACRIFICED` flag, honored by the sacrifice executor — a sacrifice that can't
  happen simply no-ops). Wrap in `ConditionalStaticAbility` for time-restricted forms, e.g. Zurgo,
  Thunder's Decree: `ConditionalStaticAbility(CantBeSacrificed(GroupFilter(Token.youControl().withSubtype("Warrior"))), IsInStep(listOf(Step.END)))`.
- `GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_ENCHANTED.name, filter)` — matching permanents can't be enchanted
  (CR 303.4): an Aura can't legally target them. Honored in `TargetValidator` at Aura-cast/activation
  target legality (only the targeting step — effects that move/attach an Aura without targeting are not
  covered). (Guardian Beast)
- `GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.CANT_GAIN_CONTROL.name, filter)` — other players can't gain control of
  matching permanents. Honored in the control-change executors (`GainControl`, `GainControlByMost`,
  `ExchangeControl` — an exchange where either side can't be gained control of fails entirely); the
  controller keeping their own permanent is an unaffected no-op. (Guardian Beast)
- `AssignDamageEqualToToughness(filter, onlyWhenToughnessGreaterThanPower)` — static: matching creatures
  assign combat damage equal to their toughness rather than their power (Doran the Siege Tower, Bark of
  Doran). `CombatDamageUtils.getAssignedCombatDamage` consults it. For the **turn-scoped, granted** form
  (Bill the Pony: "Until end of turn, target creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its
  toughness rather than its power"), grant the `AbilityFlag.ASSIGNS_COMBAT_DAMAGE_AS_TOUGHNESS` flag via
  `Effects.GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.ASSIGNS_COMBAT_DAMAGE_AS_TOUGHNESS, target, duration)`; the same combat
  util reads it from projected keywords (unconditional — no toughness > power gate).
- **Untap-step restriction flags** — granted via `GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.X.name)` and read by the untap
  step (`BeginningPhaseManager`) off projected keywords, so they vanish when the granting source leaves play:
  - `AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP` — "doesn't untap during its controller's untap step" (Charmed Sleep,
    Temporal Distortion's hourglass-counter form).
  - `AbilityFlag.MAY_NOT_UNTAP` — controller may choose not to untap it (Everglove Courier).
  - `AbilityFlag.REMOVE_COUNTER_TO_UNTAP` — "If this would untap during your untap step, remove a +1/+1
    counter from it instead. If you do, untap it." (Bewitching Leechcraft). During the controller's untap
    step the engine tries to remove a +1/+1 counter; the permanent untaps **only if** one was removed,
    otherwise it stays tapped (and a `CountersRemovedEvent` + `UntappedEvent` are emitted when it does).
    Engine-wired through `untapOrConsumeStun` (`rules-engine/core/UntapHelpers.kt`), which applies it only on
    the natural untap step (callers pass projected state); explicit "untap target permanent" effects and
    other players' untap steps (Seedborn Muse) pass `projected = null` and never apply it — matching the
    "during **your** untap step" wording. Stacks after the stun-counter replacement (CR 122.1d, checked first).
- `MustBlock(filter = source())` — matching creatures must block each combat if able (Grand Melee).
- `MustBeBlocked(allCreatures = false)` — static: the source creature must be blocked while active —
  "if able" (≥1 blocker, default) or by **all** able blockers (`allCreatures = true`, Lure-style).
  Static counterpart of `MustBeBlockedEffect`; `BlockPhaseManager` honors it alongside the floating
  must-be-blocked modifications. Wrap in `ConditionalStaticAbility(_, condition)` for the gated form
  (Frodo Baggins: `ConditionalStaticAbility(MustBeBlocked(), Conditions.SourceIsRingBearer)`).
- `CantBeBlockedByMoreThan(maxBlockers)` — static cap on how many creatures may block the source (CR
  509.1b). For the **turn-scoped, granted** form (Glorfindel, Dauntless Rescuer: "can't be blocked by
  more than one creature each combat this turn"), grant `AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED_BY_MORE_THAN_ONE`
  via `Effects.GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED_BY_MORE_THAN_ONE, target, duration)`;
  `BlockPhaseManager.validateMaxBlockersRequirements` reads the projected flag (cap = 1) alongside the
  printed `CantBeBlockedByMoreThan` static, taking the smaller cap.
- `CantBlockCreaturesWithGreaterPower(filter = source())` — blocker-side evasion (Spitfire Handler): this
  creature can't block creatures whose projected power exceeds its own.
- `CantBeBlockedByCreaturesWithLessPower(filter = source())` — attacker-side dual (Formation Breaker): this
  creature can't be blocked by creatures whose projected power is less than its own. Resolved by
  `CantBeBlockedByCreaturesWithLessPowerRule`; both sides use projected power, so a P/T buff raises the
  threshold.
- `Effects.CreatePermanentEmblem(...)` — emblem with static abilities (planeswalker ultimates).
- `AttackTax(amountPerAttacker: DynamicAmount, condition: Condition? = null)` — Propaganda / Ghostly
  Prison / Windborn Muse / Collective Restraint. Per-attacker generic-mana tax for attacking the
  source's controller (and their planeswalkers); the amount is a `DynamicAmount` so it can scale with
  state (e.g., `DynamicAmounts.domain()` for "{X} where X is your domain"). Evaluated with the source
  permanent's controller as "you". The optional `condition` gates the whole tax on the source's own
  state, evaluated with the source as "you"/source — e.g. Archangel of Tithes
  (`condition = Conditions.SourceIsUntapped`, "As long as this creature is untapped, …"); when null
  the tax is always active. When `totalTax > 0`, the engine pauses `DeclareAttackers` for a
  `SelectManaSourcesDecision` *before* tapping any mana — declining is a clean no-op that leaves the
  player in `DECLARE_ATTACKERS` to re-declare.
- `BlockTax(amountPerBlocker: DynamicAmount, condition: Condition? = null)` — Archangel of Tithes'
  second ability ("creatures can't block unless their controller pays {1} for each of those
  creatures"). A *global* per-blocker generic-mana tax: while any permanent with this ability — whose
  optional `condition` holds — is on the battlefield, every declared blocker is taxed `amountPerBlocker`
  (multiple sources stack). The optional `condition` gates the tax on the source's own state — e.g.
  Archangel uses `Conditions.SourceIsAttacking` ("As long as this creature is attacking, …"). Block
  declaration pauses for the same mana-source confirmation as the attack tax. The pre-existing
  per-creature-type block tax (Whipgrass Entangler) uses `AttackBlockTaxPerCreatureType` floating
  effects instead.
- `CantBeAttackedWithout(keyword, attackerFilter = null)` — Form of the Dragon-style "Creatures
  without flying can't attack you." defender-side restriction. Optional `attackerFilter` narrows
  which attackers are restricted (evaluated with the source permanent as predicate source, so
  chosen-color/subtype predicates resolve against it) — e.g. Teferi's Moat:
  `CantBeAttackedWithout(Keyword.FLYING, GameObjectFilter.Creature.sharingChosenColorWithSource())`.
- `CantAttackUnlessCoAttacker(coAttackerFilter, filter = source)` — "This creature can't attack
  unless [a creature matching coAttackerFilter] also attacks" (Scarred Puma). Unlike
  `CantAttackUnless` (which is defender-relative), this depends on the whole proposed attacker
  group, so it's validated against the other declared attackers at declaration time (projected
  state; self never counts as its own co-attacker).
- `AttackerCountLimit(maxAttackers)` / `BlockerCountLimit(maxBlockers)` — global combat caps
  (Dueling Grounds — "No more than one creature can attack/block each combat"). Constrain the
  *total* declared attacker/blocker set across all players, not a single creature, so they are
  enforced as a whole-declaration check in `AttackPhaseManager`/`BlockPhaseManager` rather than a
  per-creature rule. While any permanent with the ability is on the battlefield, declaring more
  than the smallest cap is rejected. (`BlockerCountLimit` counts distinct blocking creatures.)
- `AdditionalETBOrLTBTriggers(filter, mustBeYouControl = true, directions = setOf(ENTERING))` —
  the Panharmonicon family (CR 603.2d "triggers additional times"). When a permanent matching
  `filter` crosses the battlefield boundary in one of `directions`, triggered abilities of
  permanents controlled by this ability's controller that fired from that event trigger an
  additional time per copy. Default `{ENTERING}` covers Panharmonicon / Naban / Traveling Chocobo;
  `mustBeYouControl = false` drops the "X you control" restriction on the cause (Starfield
  Vocalist); adding `BattlefieldDirection.LEAVING` covers Gandalf the White's "entering or leaving
  the battlefield" wording. `TriggerDetector.duplicateETBOrLTBTriggers`; additive across copies.
- `AdditionalSourceTriggers(sourceFilter, excludeSelf = true)` — Twinflame Travelers: all triggered
  abilities of permanents matching `sourceFilter` you control trigger an additional time (not just ETB).
  `TriggerDetector.duplicateSourceTriggers`.
- `AdditionalAttackTriggers(attackerFilter = GameObjectFilter.Any)` — Windcrag Siege (Mardu): the
  attack-cause analogue of `AdditionalETBOrLTBTriggers`. If a creature matching `attackerFilter`
  being declared as an attacker causes an attack-related triggered ability ("whenever a creature
  attacks" / "whenever you attack") of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an
  additional time. `TriggerDetector.duplicateAttackTriggers`; additive across copies.

**Spell cost statics — `ModifySpellCost`**

Replaces the per-shape cost classes. Use directly as the `ability` of a `staticAbility { }` block.

```kotlin
staticAbility {
    ability = ModifySpellCost(
        target = SpellCostTarget.YouCast(GameObjectFilter.Any),
        modification = CostModification.ReduceGeneric(2),
        gating = CostGating.NthOfTypePerTurn(2),
    )
}
```

- `target: SpellCostTarget` — `SelfCast`, `YouCast(filter)`, `AnyCaster(filter)`,
  `OpponentsCastTargeting(GroupFilter)`, `OpponentsCastFromZones(zones, filter?)`, `YouCastFromZones(zones, filter?)`, `FaceDownYouCast`, `MorphActivation`.
  - `OpponentsCastFromZones(zones, filter = Any)` — spells the source-controller's opponents cast **from one of `zones`** (matched against the spell's actual cast zone, threaded as `fromZone`), matching `filter`. Pair with `CostModification.IncreaseGeneric(n)` for the Aven Interrupter shape: `OpponentsCastFromZones(setOf(Zone.GRAVEYARD, Zone.EXILE))` + `IncreaseGeneric(2)` = "Spells your opponents cast from graveyards or from exile cost {2} more to cast."
  - `YouCastFromZones(zones, filter = Any)` — the you-cast analogue: spells the **source's controller** casts **from one of `zones`**, matching `filter`. Pair with `CostModification.ReduceGeneric(n)` for Doc Aurlock, Grizzled Genius: `YouCastFromZones(setOf(Zone.GRAVEYARD, Zone.EXILE))` + `ReduceGeneric(2)` = "Spells you cast from your graveyard or from exile cost {2} less to cast." (Only the normal-cast path threads `fromZone`; alternative-cost casts such as flashback compute their own base cost and are unaffected.)
- `modification: CostModification` — `ReduceGeneric(amount)`, `ReduceGenericBy(source)`,
  `ReduceColored(symbols)`, `ReduceColoredPerUnit(symbols, source)`,
  `ReduceColoredIfAnyTargetMatches(symbols, filter)` (target-gated **colored** reduction — the
  colored analogue of the `FixedIfAnyTargetMatches` reduction source, which only reduces generic;
  removes the given colored pips if the spell targets a matching object. Brush Off's "costs
  {1}{U} less if it targets an instant or sorcery spell" pairs `ReduceColoredIfAnyTargetMatches("{U}",
  InstantOrSorcery)` for the `{U}` with `ReduceGenericBy(FixedIfAnyTargetMatches(1, InstantOrSorcery))`
  for the `{1}`, both gated on the same filter so they apply together. Like the generic gated
  reduction, affordability enumeration only optimistically discounts when a matching *battlefield*
  permanent exists; a stack-spell target reduction shows at full cost during enumeration and locks
  in once targets are announced), `IncreaseGeneric(amount)`,
  `IncreaseColored(symbols)` (colored tax — adds colored pips, e.g. the Invasion Leeches'
  "White spells you cast cost {W} more"), `IncreaseGenericPerOtherSpellThisTurn(amountPerSpell)`,
  `IncreaseGenericIfAnyTargetMatches(amount, filter)` (target-gated tax — "{N} more if it targets
  a Dragon", Dragon's Prey; the increase analogue of the `FixedIfAnyTargetMatches` reduction;
  applies only once a matching target is chosen, so affordability enumeration treats it as not
  applying), `IncreaseLife(amount)`.
  Reduction `source: CostReductionSource` covers fixed amounts, counts of permanents/cards in
  zones, target gates, and a few mechanic-specific shapes — e.g. `Fixed`, `CreaturesYouControl`,
  `ArtifactsYouControl`, `PermanentsYouControlMatching(filter)` (the filtered "you control" count —
  Temur Battlecrier's "creature you control with power 4 or greater" via
  `GameObjectFilter.Creature.powerAtLeast(4)`), `PermanentsOnBattlefieldMatching(filter)` (the
  same, all players), `PermanentsSacrificedThisTurn(amountPerPermanent = 1)` (the count of
  permanents sacrificed this turn by *any* player — not controller-scoped — reading the
  turn-scoped `GameState.permanentsSacrificedThisTurn` counter; The Balrog, Durin's Bane),
  `CardsInGraveyardMatchingFilter`, `FixedIfAnyTargetMatches`, … — see
  `CostStaticAbilities.kt` for the full list.
- `gating: CostGating` — gates whether/how often the modifier fires:
  - `None` (default) — applies to every matching cast.
  - `NthOfTypePerTurn(n)` — only when this is the Nth matching spell each turn (1-indexed; counts the
    spell currently being cast). Use `n = 1` for "the first ... each turn" (Eluge); use
    `NthOfTypePerTurn(2)` with `target = YouCast(GameObjectFilter.Any)` for Uthros Psionicist's "the
    second spell you cast each turn costs {2} less". Requires a filter-bearing target
    (`YouCast` / `AnyCaster`) — it needs a notion of "type" to count.
  - `OnlyIf(condition)` — applies only while `condition` holds at cast time (evaluated with the
    caster as controller). Gates the *whole* modification, so it composes with the dynamic per-unit
    reductions that a fixed-amount source can't express: Temur Battlecrier's "During your turn, …"
    is `OnlyIf(Conditions.IsYourTurn)` over `ReduceGenericBy(PermanentsYouControlMatching(…))`. For a
    fixed conditional reduction pair it with `ReduceGeneric` (Mental Modulation:
    `ReduceGeneric(1)` gated by `OnlyIf(IsYourTurn)`; Lashwhip Predator / Arwen's Gift gate on a
    `Compare(...)`).

**Plot cost statics — `ModifyPlotCost`**

Plot (CR 718) is a *special action*, not a spell, so `ModifySpellCost` never touches it.
`ModifyPlotCost(target, modification)` is its dedicated cost modifier, evaluated by the engine's
`PlotCostReducer` (consulted by both the plot legal-action enumerator and the plot handler so
affordability and payment stay in lockstep).

```kotlin
staticAbility {
    ability = ModifyPlotCost(
        target = PlotCostTarget.YouPlotFromHand,
        modification = CostModification.ReduceGeneric(2),
    )
}
```

- `target: PlotCostTarget` — currently `YouPlotFromHand` (cards the source's controller plots from
  hand; a future "plot from top of library" / Fblthp variant slots in as a new `PlotCostTarget`
  without changing call sites).
- `modification: CostModification` — reuses the spell-cost vocabulary, but only the flat generic
  shapes (`ReduceGeneric` / `IncreaseGeneric`) are meaningful since a printed plot cost is a flat
  mana cost; generic is floored at {0} and colored pips are never reduced. Doc Aurlock, Grizzled
  Genius: "Plotting cards from your hand costs {2} less" = `ReduceGeneric(2)`.

**Global denial statics** (no `filter`/`duration` block — they're singleton-style)

- `PreventCycling` — "Players can't cycle cards." (Stabilizer)
- `PreventActivatedAbilities(filter, nonManaAbilitiesOnly = false)` — activated abilities of
  matching permanents can't be activated; loyalty abilities and animation costs that haven't yet
  produced a creature are unaffected. By default both mana and non-mana abilities are blocked
  (Cursed Totem → `GameObjectFilter.Creature`). With `nonManaAbilitiesOnly = true`, mana abilities
  stay usable and only non-mana abilities are blocked — the "… can't be activated unless they're
  mana abilities" wording (Sharkey, Tyrant of the Shire → `GameObjectFilter.Land.opponentControls()`).
- `HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfLinkedExiledCard` (data object) — the source permanent gains **all
  activated abilities of every card in its linked-exile pile** (`LinkedExileComponent`). Resolved
  dynamically at activation-legality time: the engine pulls each exiled card's `activatedAbilities`
  and surfaces them on the source, with the source as granter (so `{T}` taps the source and
  "this card" self-references bind to the source — CR-faithful). Grants *activated* abilities only,
  not triggered/static/replacement. Pair with `Effects.ExileLinkedToSource(target)` to fill the
  pile. (Territory Forge.)
- `SuppressEntersTriggers(filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature)` — permanents matching `filter`
  entering the battlefield don't cause abilities to trigger (CR 603.6 enters-the-battlefield
  triggers). Suppresses both the entering permanent's *own* ETB triggers and any other permanent's
  "whenever a [...] enters" trigger whose triggering object is that permanent — the gate is whether
  the *entering object* matches `filter` in projected state (continuous effects apply), not what the
  watching trigger names. Replacement effects (enters with counters/tapped) and `EntersWithChoice`
  "as it enters" choices are unaffected (they aren't triggered abilities). Torpor Orb / Hushwing Gryff
  → `SuppressEntersTriggers()`; Tocatli Honor Guard → `SuppressEntersTriggers(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl())`.
- `GainActivatedAbilitiesOfPermanents(grantedTo, sourceFilter, includeManaAbilities = false)` —
  permanents matching `grantedTo` (a `GroupFilter`; use `GroupFilter.source()` for "this permanent")
  gain copies of the activated abilities of every permanent matching `sourceFilter`. The copy uses
  the gaining permanent as its source (CR 113.2), so a copied `SacrificeSelf`/`{T}` refers to the
  gainer. The dynamic, copy-from-other-permanents sibling of `GrantActivatedAbility`. Mana abilities
  are excluded unless `includeManaAbilities = true`. (Sharkey, Tyrant of the Shire — "Sharkey has all
  activated abilities of lands your opponents control except mana abilities")
- `SpendAnyManaTypeForActivatedAbilities(filter)` — mana of any type can be spent to pay the mana
  portion of the activated-ability costs of permanents matching `filter` (a `GroupFilter`; use
  `GroupFilter.source()` for "this permanent's abilities"). Relaxes colored/hybrid/Phyrexian/colorless
  pips to generic per CR 118.14 / 609.4b; non-mana cost components are untouched. Honored by both
  affordability checks and the mana solver. (Sharkey, Tyrant of the Shire — "Mana of any type can be
  spent to activate Sharkey's abilities")
- `PreventManaPoolEmptying` — mana pools don't empty between steps/phases. (Upwelling)
- `NoMaximumHandSize` — controller has no hand-size limit *while this permanent is on the
  battlefield*. (Thought Vessel, Reliquary Tower) For a one-shot resolution effect that confers a
  *permanent, player-scoped* "no maximum hand size for the rest of the game" (survives the source
  leaving play), use the effect `Effects.RemoveMaximumHandSize(target)` instead — see §4. (Wisdom of Ages)
- `DampLandManaProduction` — a land tapped for 2+ mana produces `{C}` instead. (Damping Sphere)
- `RestrictSpellsCastPerTurn(maxPerTurn, eachPlayer = false)` — a per-turn cap on spells cast.
  `eachPlayer = false` (default) limits only the source's controller (Yawgmoth's Agenda: "You can't
  cast more than one spell each turn."); `eachPlayer = true` is a *global* restriction binding every
  player (High Noon: "Each player can't cast more than one spell each turn."). The most restrictive
  `maxPerTurn` applies when several are in play. Already-cast spells count, even those cast before this
  permanent entered.
- `CantCastSpellsSharingColorWithLastCast` — *global* (all players): can't cast a spell that shares a
  color with the spell most recently cast this turn. Backed by `GameState.lastCastSpellColors` (the
  colors of the last spell cast, cleared each turn). Never blocks the first spell of the turn; a
  colorless spell shares no color, so it is always castable and casting one lifts the restriction
  until the next colored spell. (Mana Maze)
- `PlayersCantCastSpells(affected = Player.EachOpponent, spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.Any, condition = null)`
  — continuous cast *prohibition* parameterized along three independent axes, each a reused
  primitive: **who** (`affected`, a `Player` reference *relative to the source's controller* —
  `EachOpponent`/`Opponent`, `You`, `Each`), **which** (`spellFilter`, matched against the card being
  cast), and **when** (`condition`, evaluated in the controller's context, so `IsYourTurn` = "during
  your turn", `IsNotYourTurn` = "during an opponent's turn"; `null` = always). Read at cast-legality
  time through the single `CastPermissionUtils.reasonCannotCast` chokepoint, so it covers every
  casting zone (hand, flashback/harmonize, exile, top of library) uniformly; control is read from
  projected state. Examples: Voice of Victory = `PlayersCantCastSpells(Player.EachOpponent, condition
  = IsYourTurn)`; Grand Abolisher's cast clause = `PlayersCantCastSpells(Player.EachOpponent, condition
  = IsYourTurn)`; Void Winnower = `PlayersCantCastSpells(Player.EachOpponent, spellFilter =
  GameObjectFilter(cardPredicates = listOf(CardPredicate.ManaValueIsEven)))`.
- `PlayersCantActivateAbilities(affected = Player.EachOpponent, permanentFilter = GameObjectFilter.Any, condition = null)`
  — continuous *activation* prohibition, the activated-ability twin of `PlayersCantCastSpells`,
  parameterized along the same three axes: **who** (`affected`, relative to the source's controller),
  **which** (`permanentFilter`, matched in projected state against the *permanent whose ability is being
  activated* — not the ability itself), and **when** (`condition`, evaluated in the controller's
  context). Read at ability-activation-legality time on every battlefield permanent
  (`CastPermissionUtils.isActivationPreventedForPlayer`, consulted by the activate handler + the
  activated/mana-ability enumerators), so it blocks mana and non-mana abilities alike. Unlike the
  who/when-blind `PreventActivatedAbilities` (Cursed Totem), it additionally scopes by who is activating
  and when. Grand Abolisher's activate clause = `PlayersCantActivateAbilities(Player.EachOpponent,
  permanentFilter = GameObjectFilter.Artifact or GameObjectFilter.Creature or GameObjectFilter.Enchantment,
  condition = IsYourTurn)` ("During your turn, your opponents can't activate abilities of artifacts,
  creatures, or enchantments."); loyalty abilities and land mana abilities are unaffected because the
  filter only matches those three permanent types.

**Tapped-for-mana mana statics** (extra mana / replaced mana when a land is tapped for mana — resolve
inline as triggered mana abilities, off the stack per CR 605). These fire on the *manual* mana-ability
path; automatic cost payment adds the extra/replacement *mana* via the solver but skips non-mana
riders, matching how the engine already treats e.g. City of Brass's damage during auto-pay.

- `AdditionalManaOnTap(color, amount, anyColor = false)` — aura: "Whenever enchanted land is tapped
  for mana, its controller adds additional mana." `color = null` reads the aura's `ChosenColorComponent`;
  `anyColor = true` makes it one mana of **any color the controller chooses** each tap (prompts on a
  manual tap; flexible for the solver). (Elvish Guidance = fixed `{G}`; **Fertile Ground** = `anyColor`)
- `AdditionalManaOnSourceTap(sourceFilter, color = null, amount = 1, rider = null)` — global: "Whenever
  a `<sourceFilter>` is tapped for mana, that player adds …". `color = null` mirrors the produced color.
  `rider` is an optional non-mana `Effect` resolved inline, controlled by the tapping player
  (`EffectTarget.Controller` = tapper, `EffectTarget.Self` = the static's source). (Lavaleaper = basic-land
  mirror; Badgermole Cub = `+{G}`; **Overabundance** = `GameObjectFilter.Land` mirror + `DealDamage(1,
  Controller)` rider; **Roxanne, Starfall Savant** = `GameObjectFilter.Artifact.token().youControl()`
  mirror). The mirror fires for both fixed-color producers (handled synchronously) and **any-color**
  producers whose color is chosen at tap time (e.g. Roxanne's Meteorite "{T}: Add one mana of any
  color" — the mirror is applied after the color choice resolves, in the color-choice continuation).
- `ReplaceLandManaColor(filter)` — global: lands matching `filter` produce one mana of a color of their
  controller's choice instead of their normal mana. Implemented by swapping the land's base mana effect
  for "add one mana of any color", so the choice flows through the normal any-color machinery (manual tap
  prompts; solver treats a matched basic as a five-color source). (**Pulse of Llanowar** =
  `GameObjectFilter.BasicLand.youControl()`)
- `OverrideEnchantedLandManaColor(color)` — aura: replaces the enchanted land's *own* produced color with
  a fixed/aura-chosen `color` (vs. `ReplaceLandManaColor`'s filter-based, free-choice form). (Shimmerwilds Growth)

**Alternative play / cast permissions** (let a player play or cast cards from non-hand zones)

- `MayPlayLandsFromGraveyard` — play lands from your graveyard (no per-turn cap). (Icetill Explorer)
- `MayPlayPermanentsFromGraveyard` — Muldrotha: play a land + cast one permanent spell of each
  permanent type from your graveyard each turn (per-type-per-turn cap).
- `EquipAbilitiesAtInstantSpeed` — the controller may activate equip abilities any time they could
  cast an instant (CR 702.6e timing lifted). Wrap in a `ConditionalStaticAbility` (the
  `staticAbility { condition = …; ability = EquipAbilitiesAtInstantSpeed }` DSL form) for a gated
  grant — Forge Anew uses `condition = Conditions.IsYourTurn` for its "During your turn …" clause;
  a bare grant (Leonin Shikari) applies unconditionally. Consulted by `CastPermissionUtils
  .canEquipAtInstantSpeed` (enumerator) and `ActivateAbilityHandler.validate` (submit path), both
  keyed on `ActivatedAbility.isEquipAbility`.
- `FreeFirstEquipEachTurn` — the controller may pay {0} rather than the equip cost of the **first**
  equip ability they activate during each of their turns (Forge Anew). The engine zeroes the whole
  cost (colored pips included) of the turn's first equip while the per-player
  `EquipActivationsThisTurnComponent.count == 0`, and increments that counter on every equip
  activation (reset at turn start by `TurnManager`).
- `ReduceEquipCost(amount)` — the controller's equip abilities cost `{amount}` generic mana less to
  activate (Éowyn, Lady of Rohan: "Equip abilities you activate cost {1} less to activate"). The
  engine reduces only the generic portion of the equip cost (floored at {0}); colored pips are
  untouched, and multiple sources stack additively. Controller-scoped — it applies to every equip
  ability the controller activates, regardless of which permanent bears the equip ability. Consulted
  by `CastPermissionUtils.applyEquipCostReduction` from both the enumerator (displayed cost) and
  `ActivateAbilityHandler` (paid cost), keyed on `ActivatedAbility.isEquipAbility` and applied before
  the `FreeFirstEquipEachTurn` discount. Wrap in a `ConditionalStaticAbility` for a "during your
  turn"-style gate.
- `MayCastFromGraveyard(filter, lifeCost = 0, duringYourTurnOnly = false)` — cast spells matching
  `filter` from your graveyard following normal timing, optionally paying `lifeCost` life. Free for
  Yawgmoth's Agenda (`MayCastFromGraveyard(Nonland)`); `lifeCost = 1, duringYourTurnOnly = true` for
  Festival of Embers. Pair with `MayPlayLandsFromGraveyard` for "play lands and cast spells from
  your graveyard". Lands are *played*, not cast, so they need the lands permission separately.
- `GrantWarpToCardsInHand(filter, cost)` — cards in the controller's hand matching `filter` gain
  warp (CR 702.185) with mana cost `cost`. Behaves identically to a printed warp keyword: surfaces a
  "Cast (Warp)" legal action, marks `wasWarped` on resolution, and the post-resolution permanent is
  exiled at the next end step and can be cast again from exile for its regular mana cost. Hand-only
  by CR 702.185a and the granters' "in your hand" wording — the grant doesn't extend warp to other
  zones. Routed through `WarpGrants.effectiveWarp` alongside printed warp; the granter's controller
  is the only beneficiary. (Tannuk, Steadfast Second = `GrantWarpToCardsInHand(filter = artifact OR
  red creature, cost = {2}{R})`.) When the granted warp lands on a card that *also* has another
  alternative cost (e.g. a red evoke creature), both casts are offered and disambiguated by
  `CastSpell.alternativeCostType` (see `engine-server-interface.md`) — picking "Evoke" charges the
  evoke cost, not warp, even though warp would win a naive priority order.
- `GrantKeywordToOwnSpells(keyword, spellFilter = Creature)` — while this permanent is on the battlefield,
  spells its controller casts matching `spellFilter` effectively have `keyword` ("you cast" semantics). Read by
  the cast machinery via `GrantedKeywordResolver`:
  - **Cost-modifying keywords** (CONVOKE, DELVE) surface in the cast enumerator / alternative-payment handler —
    e.g. **Eirdu, Carrier of Dawn** (`GrantKeywordToOwnSpells(CONVOKE, Creature)`), **Teval, Arbiter of Virtue**
    (`DELVE`).
  - **STORM** (and other "each instance triggers separately" cast keywords) are counted by
    `GrantedKeywordResolver.countGrants` when `CastSpellHandler` builds the spell's storm triggers — one storm
    instance per matching grant (CR 702.40b), added to the printed-keyword count. **Prismari, the Inspiration** =
    `GrantKeywordToOwnSpells(STORM, InstantOrSorcery)`. Removing the granter before the spell is cast revokes the
    grant. (Cascade-style granted keywords are instead modelled as a `youCastSpell(...)`-triggered `Effects.Cascade`
    on the granter — see **Quandrix, the Proof** / Wildsear, Scouring Maw — since cascade is a cast trigger, not a
    cost keyword.)
- `MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost(controllerOnly = false, firstSpellOfTurnOnly = false, spellFilter = Any)` — a
  battlefield permission to cast a spell without paying its mana cost (CR 118.9). Composable
  gates: `controllerOnly = true` restricts the benefit to the source's controller ("you" wording);
  `firstSpellOfTurnOnly = true` requires the caster to be the active player and to have cast
  zero spells this turn; `spellFilter` restricts *which* spells may be cast for free (card
  predicates, matched in any zone — default `GameObjectFilter.Any` = every spell). Weftwalking is
  `MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost(firstSpellOfTurnOnly = true)`; Dracogenesis is
  `MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost(controllerOnly = true, spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype("Dragon"))`
  ("You may cast Dragon spells without paying their mana costs"); a future "you may cast the first
  spell you cast each turn …" composes via both gates true. The filter is enforced per-spell in
  `CostCalculator.hasFreeCastPermission(state, casterId, spellCardDef)` (the enumerator threads the
  card being cast through `EnumerationContext.freeCastPermissionFor(cardId)`).
  Cast-legality is checked by `CostCalculator.hasFreeCastPermission`. Surfaced as a dedicated
  `CastWithoutPayingManaCost` `LegalAction` variant routed through
  `CastSpell.useWithoutPayingManaCost = true` — emitted **alongside** Jodah-style
  `GrantAlternativeCastingCost`, flashback, harmonize, warp, evoke, impending, and
  `selfAlternativeCost` variants so the player explicitly picks one (CR 118.9a — only one
  alternative cost may apply to a cast, and which one is the player's choice, not handler
  priority). `CastSpellHandler.validate` rejects combining the flag with `useAlternativeCost`.
  When chosen, the cast is treated as `playForFree` (cost zeroed, X = 0 per CR 107.3b, kicker
  / blight / behold / runtime tax skipped; mandatory additional costs like Embrace Oblivion's
  sacrifice are still enforced), matching the existing `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent` flow
  used by Cascade and Omniscience.

**Top-of-library reveal & play** (reveal the top card of a library, optionally with permission to
play it from there). Visibility (public reveal to all players) and play permission are separate
concerns — the `ClientStateTransformer` reveals the top card for `PlayFromTopOfLibrary` *or*
`RevealTopOfLibrary`, while the cast/play-from-top paths key only on the play-granting variants.

- `RevealTopOfLibrary` — *public reveal only*, no play permission: the controller's top card is
  shown to all players, but can only be played once drawn. (**Goblin Spy**)
- `PlayFromTopOfLibrary` — public reveal **and** "play lands and cast spells from the top of your
  library" (all card types). (Future Sight)
- `PlayLandsAndCastFilteredFromTopOfLibrary(spellFilter)` — like `PlayFromTopOfLibrary` but only
  spells matching `spellFilter` are castable (lands always playable). (Glarb, Calamity's Augur =
  `GameObjectFilter.Any.manaValueAtLeast(4)`)
- `CastSpellTypesFromTopOfLibrary(filter)` — cast only matching spell types from the top; no land
  play, no full public reveal. (Precognition Field = instants/sorceries)
- `LookAtTopOfLibrary` — *private*: the controller may look at their own top card any time (revealed
  only to them, not opponents). (Lens of Clarity, Vizier of the Menagerie)
- `PlotFromTopOfLibrary(filter = Nonland)` — the controller may **plot** (CR 718) the top card of
  their library if it matches `filter`, paying a plot cost equal to the card's mana cost. The plot
  legal-action enumerator offers the top card as a plot action and `PlotCardHandler` moves it from
  library → exile and plots it (sorcery-speed special action; can't be cast the turn it's plotted).
  Grants an *additional* way to plot — a card with its own printed plot cost may still use that. Pair
  with `LookAtTopOfLibrary` so the controller can see the card. (Fblthp, Lost on the Range =
  nonland.)
- `OpponentsPlayWithHandsRevealed` — visibility-only, the opponent-facing sibling of
  `RevealTopOfLibrary`: each opponent of the controller plays with their hand publicly visible to
  that controller (no other game effect). Handled entirely by the client state transformer's
  hand-masking seam. (**Seer's Vision**)

    restriction = ActivationRestriction.MaxPerTurn(1)
}
```

**`TimingRule`**

- `Normal` — at instant speed (default for most abilities).
- `ManaAbility` — resolves immediately, doesn't use the stack (CR 605).
- `SorcerySpeed` — only during your main phase, empty stack.
- `OnlyIfCondition(c)` — guarded by a runtime condition.

**`ActivationRestriction`**

- `MaxPerTurn(n)` — at most N activations per turn.
- `OnlyOnce` — once per game.
- `OnlyIfCondition(c)` — condition gate.

**Loyalty abilities**

- `loyaltyAbility(+N) { ... }` — add loyalty + effect.
- `loyaltyAbility(-N) { ... }` — remove loyalty + effect.
- `loyaltyAbility(0) { ... }` — 0-loyalty ability.

(nonbasic landwalk variant — `Keyword.DESERTWALK`, keyed off `Subtype.DESERT`), Nonbasic landwalk

composite abilities).

**Parameterized `KeywordAbility.*`**

- `Ward(amount)` — opponent pays a mana cost to target this (CR 702.21). Non-mana costs use
  `KeywordAbility.Ward(WardCost.X)`: `WardCost.Mana`, `WardCost.Life(n)`, `WardCost.Discard(n, random, filter)`,
  and `WardCost.Sacrifice(filter)` ("Ward—Sacrifice a Food", Ygra). For sacrifice ward, the opponent
  chooses which matching permanent(s) they control to sacrifice (declining counters their spell); valid
  fodder is matched against projected state, so subtypes granted by continuous effects count.
  Composite costs ("Ward—{2}, Pay 2 life", Gisa, the Hellraiser) use
  `KeywordAbility.wardComposite(WardCost.Mana("{2}"), WardCost.Life(2))` → `WardCost.Composite(parts)`.
  The components are charged one at a time in order; the spell/ability resolves only if every
  component is paid, and declining or being unable to pay any one component counters it (CR 702.21a).
  Each component reuses the same per-cost decision flow as a standalone ward, so a composite cost
  shows one prompt per component. `parts` must be flat atomic ward costs (no nested `Composite`).
  `WardCost.Discard` (built via `KeywordAbility.wardDiscard(count, random, filter)`) takes an optional
  `GameObjectFilter`: when set, only matching hand cards count toward the can-pay check and only matching
  cards are offered for discard — e.g. Saruman of Many Colors' "Ward—Discard an enchantment, instant, or
  sorcery card" (`wardDiscard(filter = Enchantment or Instant or Sorcery)`).
- `Protection(color)` — protection from a single color.
- `ProtectionFrom(set)` — protection from a set of colors/types.
- `Protection(ProtectionScope.Supertype("Legendary"))` / `KeywordAbility.protectionFromSupertype("Legendary")` — protection from a supertype, e.g. "protection from legendary creatures" (Tsabo Tavoc). Enforced across targeting, blocking, and combat damage via projected `PROTECTION_FROM_SUPERTYPE_<X>` keywords.
- `Affinity(filter)` — cost reduction per matching permanent.
- `Amplify(n)` — ETB reveal-creatures-for-counters.
- `Devour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, variant)` — "As this enters, you may sacrifice any number of [sacrificeFilter]. It enters with [multiplier] × that many +1/+1 counters." Plain Devour uses `sacrificeFilter = Creature` and `variant = ""`; the Edge of Eternities variant "Devour land N" uses `KeywordAbility.devourLand(n)` (`sacrificeFilter = Land`, `variant = "land"`). The keyword surfaces the rules text; pair with [`EntersWithDevour`](#15-replacement-effects) for the mechanical behavior.
- `Annihilator(n)` — attacker forces sacrifices.
- `Absorb(n)` — prevent N damage each time it would be dealt to this.
- `Bushido(n)` — +N/+N when blocking or blocked.
- `Rampage(n)` — +N/+N for each blocker past the first. Display-only; wire the behavior with the
  `card { rampage(n) }` builder helper, which adds this keyword ability plus a "becomes blocked"
  triggered ability granting `+n/+n × (blockers − 1)` until end of turn (mirrors `prowess()`).
- `Flurry` (Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Jeskai) — "Flurry — Whenever you cast your second spell each turn,
  [effect]." Display-only `Keyword.FLURRY`; wire the behavior with the `card { flurry { … } }` builder
  helper. Author the effect/target/optional inside the block exactly like `triggeredAbility { }` — the
  helper forces the `Triggers.NthSpellCast(2, Player.You)` trigger, adds the FLURRY tag, and prefixes the
  rendered text with "Flurry — Whenever you cast your second spell each turn," (mirrors `prowess()` /
  `rampage()`). The second-spell-cast event is matched by `EventPattern.NthSpellCastEvent`; no new engine
  subsystem is involved. Example: `flurry { effect = Effects.DealDamage(1, EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.EachOpponent), damageSource = EffectTarget.Self) }`.
- `Casualty(threshold)` (`KeywordAbility.casualty(n)`) — Casualty N (CR 702.153): "As an additional
  cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a creature with power N or greater. When you do, copy
  this spell and you may choose new targets for the copy." Modeled like Conspire — an optional
  additional cost plus a reflexive triggered copy (reuses `StormCopyEffect` with `copyCount = 1`).
  The cast enumerator surfaces a `CastWithCasualty` legal action whenever the caster controls a
  creature whose projected power meets the threshold; the chosen creature is submitted as
  `CastSpell.casualtyCreature` and sacrificed during payment. Grant it to a player's spells with
  `GrantKeywordToOwnSpells(keyword = Keyword.CASUALTY, spellFilter = …, keywordParameter = N)` —
  the `keywordParameter` carries the threshold for granted casualty (Silverquill, the Disputant:
  "Each instant and sorcery spell you cast has casualty 1"). `GrantedKeywordResolver.casualtyThreshold`
  reads the printed `KeywordAbility.Casualty.threshold` first, then the granting source's
  `keywordParameter`.
- `Miracle(cost)` (`KeywordAbility.miracle(cost)`) — Miracle {cost} (CR 702.94): "You may cast this
  card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn." Modeled as a
  hand-only alternative cost gated by a one-turn window. When a card with miracle (printed, or granted
  in hand — see below) is the first card its owner draws in a turn, the draw flow stamps it with a
  `MiracleWindowComponent` and reveals it (`CardRevealedFromDrawEvent`); the cast-from-hand enumerator
  then surfaces a "Miracle …" alternative-cost action (`AlternativeCostType.MIRACLE`) paying the
  miracle mana cost instead of the mana cost. The window is cleared at end of turn. Grant it to a
  player's hand cards with `GrantMiracleToCardsInHand(filter, cost)` (Lorehold, the Historian: "Each
  instant and sorcery card in your hand has miracle {2}"); `MiracleGrants.effectiveMiracle` is the
  single source of truth consulted by the draw flow, enumerator, and cast handler (printed wins, else
  the first matching battlefield grant on a permanent the player controls).
- `Afflict(n)` — defender loses N when this becomes blocked.
- `Crew(n)` (`KeywordAbility.crew(n, onceEachTurn = false)` / `Numeric(Keyword.CREW, n, onceEachTurn)`) —
  Crew N (CR 702.122): tap any number of untapped creatures you control with total power N or greater to
  animate a **Vehicle** (artifact subtype, CR 301.7) — it becomes an artifact creature until end of turn at
  its printed P/T and keywords (the engine `CrewVehicleHandler` resolves a `BecomeCreature`; surfaced as the
  `CrewVehicle` legal action). Summoning-sick creatures may crew (CR 702.122c). Pass `onceEachTurn = true` for
  "Crew N. Activate only once each turn." (Luxurious Locomotive): the crew enumerator + handler then refuse a
  second crew activation in the same turn (counted via `CrewSaddleContributorsComponent.crewActivations`, reset
  at end of turn). Vanilla Crew is uncapped. `onceEachTurn` is omitted from compiled JSON when false
  (`encodeDefaults = false`). To make a Vehicle a creature **conditionally** instead of via crew (e.g. Grond,
  the Gatebreaker — "As long as it's your turn and you control an Army, this is an artifact creature"), use a
  `staticAbility { }` with `ability = GrantCardType("CREATURE", GroupFilter.source())` gated by a `condition`
  (Layer 4 type change; printed P/T applies automatically). The same `GrantCardType("CREATURE", …)` pattern
  covers Spacecraft "it's an artifact creature at N+" (see Synthesizer Labship).
- `saddle(n)` (`KeywordAbility.saddle(n)`) — Saddle N (CR 702.171). A sorcery-speed activated
  ability whose cost is tapping any number of *other* untapped creatures you control with total
  power ≥ N; on resolution this permanent **becomes saddled** until end of turn. Reuses the same
  "tap creatures with total power N" selection as Crew (surfaced as a `SaddleMount` legal action),
  but resolves to a marker rather than animating the permanent. Read the saddled state with
  `Conditions.SourceIsSaddled` / the `saddled()` filter (e.g. `triggerCondition =
  Conditions.SourceIsSaddled` for "whenever this attacks while saddled"). The marker (engine
  `SaddledComponent`) is cleared at end of turn or when the permanent leaves the battlefield, and
  is not a copiable value (CR 702.171b). Mounts that gate on the saddled state use this.
- `Modular(n)` — ETB with +1/+1 counters, transfer on death.
- `Fading(n)` — ETB with N fade counters; removes one each upkeep, sacrifice if can't.
- `Vanishing(n)` — same idea with time counters.
- `Renown(n)` — first combat damage to a player grants renown counters.
- `Fabricate(n)` — ETB choose +1/+1 counters or Servo tokens.
- `Tribute(n)` — opponent chooses ETB bonus.
- `Mobilize(n)` — +N tapped-and-attacking 1/1 red Warrior tokens on attack (Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Mardu).
  Display-only; wire the behavior with the `card { mobilize(n) }` builder helper, which adds this keyword
  ability plus a "whenever this attacks" triggered `CreateTokenEffect` (`tapped = true`, `attacking = true`)
  whose `sacrificeAtStep = Step.END` schedules one delayed `SacrificeTargetEffect` per created token at the
  next end step (mirrors `rampage()`). `n` may be any fixed value (Mobilize 1/2/3, …).
  For a dynamic count ("Mobilize X, where X is …"), use the `card { mobilize(amount, amountDescription, label) }`
  overload: it adds a `KeywordAbility.Variable(MOBILIZE, label)` display tag (prints "Mobilize X") plus the same
  attack-triggered `CreateTokenEffect`, but with `count = amount` (any `DynamicAmount`) resolved at attack time.
  Avenger of the Fallen passes `DynamicAmounts.creatureCardsInYourGraveyard()`.
- `Firebending(n)` — "Whenever this creature attacks, add N {R}. Until end of combat, you don't lose this mana
  as steps and phases end." (CR 702.189, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Display-only; wire the behavior with the
  `card { firebending(n) }` builder helper, which adds this keyword ability plus a "whenever this attacks"
  triggered `AddManaEffect(Color.RED, n, expiry = ManaExpiry.END_OF_COMBAT)` (mirrors `mobilize()` / `rampage()`).
  The mana is ordinary red mana spendable anywhere — it is held as an `AnySpend` restricted-pool entry tagged
  with [ManaExpiry](#manaexpiry).`END_OF_COMBAT` and discarded by `CombatManager.endCombat`. It is a normal
  triggered ability (not a mana ability): it uses the stack and can be responded to. `n` may be any fixed value;
  "firebending X (X = its power)" is not yet expressible by this helper (the keyword carries only a fixed Int).
- `Increment` — "Whenever you cast a spell, if the amount of mana you spent is greater than this creature's power
  or toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature." (Secrets of Strixhaven). Display-only; wire the behavior with
  the `card { increment() }` builder helper, which adds the `KeywordAbility.Increment` display marker (surfacing
  `Keyword.INCREMENT`) plus a `Triggers.YouCastSpell` triggered `AddCounters(+1/+1, 1, Self)` gated by an
  intervening-if (CR 603.4) that compares the triggering spell's mana spent (`EntityProperty(Triggering,
  ManaSpent)`) against the source's power *or* toughness — modelled as an `AnyCondition` of two `Compare(GT)`
  arms, so it fires when the mana exceeds the smaller characteristic. No parameter (mirrors `firebending()` /
  `decayed()`).
- `Opus` — "Opus — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, [base]. If five or more mana was spent to cast
  that spell, [bonus] [instead]." (Secrets of Strixhaven). **Opus is an ability word** (CR 207.2c — flavor only),
  so it adds *no keyword*; the whole mechanic is one `Triggers.YouCastInstantOrSorcery` triggered ability wired by
  the `card { opus { … } }` builder helper. The 5+ mana tier is a `Compare` of
  `ContextProperty(MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL) >= 5` (the mana spent on the *triggering* spell, not the
  resolving object's own cast). Author the base effect as `effect = …` and pick exactly one bonus setter:
  `insteadIfFiveOrMore = …` lowers to `ConditionalEffect(5+ → bonus, otherwise → base)` and renders "… [bonus]
  instead" (Deluge Virtuoso, Exhibition Tidecaller, Tackle Artist); `alsoIfFiveOrMore = …` lowers to
  `base then ConditionalEffect(5+ → bonus)` and runs the bonus *in addition* (Expressive Firedancer, Colorstorm
  Stallion). Declare a `target(name, requirement)` inside the block and reference the returned handle from both
  `effect` and the bonus so the single chosen target carries across both tiers (Exhibition Tidecaller's "target
  player mills three … mills ten instead"). The rendered ability text is auto-composed from the base/bonus effect
  descriptions unless `description` overrides the whole string.
- `Decayed` — "This creature can't block, and when it attacks, sacrifice it at end of combat" (CR 702.147,
  Innistrad: Midnight Hunt). Display-only; wire the behavior with the `card { decayed() }` builder helper, which adds
  the keyword plus a `CantBlock(GroupFilter.source())` static ability and a "whenever this attacks" triggered
  `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step = Step.END_COMBAT, effect = Effects.SacrificeTarget(EffectTarget.Self))` (mirrors
  Mardu Blazebringer's end-of-combat self-sacrifice). No parameter. The **decayed counter** (`Counters.DECAYED`,
  Tarkir: Dragonstorm) grants the same Decayed ability to *any* creature that bears one (CR 702.147a) — put it with
  `AddCounters(Counters.DECAYED, n, target)` (Rot-Curse Rakshasa's Renew). The engine realizes the behavior off the
  counter directly: `StateProjector` projects the `DECAYED` keyword + `cantBlock = true`, and `TriggerDetector`
  schedules the end-of-combat self-sacrifice when a decayed-countered creature is declared as an attacker — no
  per-card static/trigger needed for the counter form.
- `Toxic(n)` — adds poison counters on combat damage.
- `Cycling(cost)` — pay cost, discard, draw a card.
- `BasicLandcycling(cost)` — cycling that fetches a basic land type.
- `Typecycling(type, cost)` — cycling that fetches a card type.
- `Plot(cost)` — `KeywordAbility.plot(cost)`. Special action available during your main phase while the stack is empty: pay [cost] and exile the card from your hand. It becomes plotted (stamped with a `PlottedComponent`). On a later turn you may cast it from exile without paying its mana cost, as a sorcery (CR 718). Cast permission is granted via the engine's standard `MayPlayPermission` + `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent`, gated by `Conditions.SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`. No card-side wiring needed — declare the keyword ability on the card and the engine handles the rest.
- `Hideaway(n)` — `KeywordAbility.hideaway(n)`; display tag rendered "Hideaway N". Mechanic is composed manually via `MoveCollectionEffect(faceDown = FaceDownMode.HIDDEN, linkToSource = true)` + `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()` — the keyword itself carries no engine behavior.
- `Harmonize(cost)` — `KeywordAbility.harmonize(cost)` (Tarkir: Dragonstorm). An alternative cost to cast an instant/sorcery **from your graveyard**, like Flashback, then exile it as it resolves. As you cast it you may tap **a single** untapped creature you control to reduce the **generic** portion of the harmonize cost by that creature's (projected) power — a Convoke-style reduction, but one creature paying generic-equal-to-power instead of one mana per creature. No card-side wiring: declare the keyword ability and the engine handles graveyard-cast enumeration (`CastWithHarmonize`), the per-creature reduction (routed through `AlternativePaymentChoice.harmonizeCreature`), and the exile-on-resolution. The chosen creature and its power are surfaced to the client via `LegalAction.harmonizeCreatures` / `hasHarmonize`; the client offers an on-battlefield single-creature tap step (the `harmonize` pipeline phase + `HarmonizeSelector` HUD, mirroring Convoke). **Harmonize {X}** (e.g. Nature's Rhythm `{X}{G}{G}{G}{G}`): the `CastWithHarmonize` action surfaces `hasXCost`/`maxAffordableX` (max X folds in the best single-creature tap reduction) so the client prompts for X. {X} is generic mana, so the tap reduces the mana paid *for X* — `CastSpellHandler.harmonizePaymentXValue` lowers the X mana once `reduceGeneric` has consumed any printed generic — while the chosen X stamped onto `SpellOnStackComponent.xValue` (and read by the effect, e.g. "mana value X or less") is unchanged. Colored pips are never reduced. **Granting harmonize at runtime:** harmonize can also be granted to a graveyard card that doesn't print it via `Effects.GrantHarmonize(target, cost?, duration)` (Songcrafter Mage). The grant is a `GrantedKeywordAbility` record keyed to the card entity; every harmonize read site consults printed-**or**-granted harmonize through the `HarmonizeGrants.effectiveHarmonize` resolver, so a granted harmonize is castable, reducible, and exiled exactly like a printed one. The grant survives the graveyard → stack move (so exile-on-resolution still fires) and is cleared in the cleanup step.
- **Waterbend** (Avatar: The Last Airbender) — *not a keyword ability*; a cost flag on an activated ability. Set `hasWaterbend = true` in the `activatedAbility { }` block (alongside a `cost = Costs.Mana("{N}")`). It means "Waterbend {N}: pay {N}, but for each generic mana in that cost you may tap an untapped **artifact or creature** you control instead." It is Convoke widened to artifacts and restricted to generic-only payment — a tapped permanent never covers a colored pip, and the number of taps is bounded by the generic mana in the cost (CR; you can tap a permanent that just came under your control, no summoning-sickness gate). Routed through `AlternativePaymentChoice.waterbendPermanents` (a `Set<EntityId>`), mirroring `hasConvoke`: the activated-ability handler applies it via `AlternativePaymentHandler.applyWaterbendForAbility`, the enumerator surfaces `LegalAction.hasWaterbend` / `waterbendPermanents` (via `CostEnumerationUtils.findWaterbendPermanents` + `canAffordWithWaterbend`), and the client offers an on-battlefield tap step (the `waterbend` pipeline phase + `WaterbendSelector` HUD, generic-only). The ability's `description` auto-prefixes "Waterbend " before the cost. *(Spell-level waterbend additional costs and in-resolution "may pay a waterbend cost" shapes are not yet wired — the `waterbendPermanents` carrier is reusable for them.)*
- `OptionalAdditionalCost(manaCost?, additionalCost?, multi, displayPrefix, branchesEffect, grantsFlashTiming)` — generalised "pay an optional extra cost while casting" primitive. Backs printed Kicker / Multikicker / Offspring **and** the pre-kicker "pay {N} more to cast as though it had flash" pattern (Ghitu Fire). When `branchesEffect = true` (default) paying the cost marks the spell so `WasKicked` fires for the card's own effect/triggers; when `false` the payment is invisible to `WasKicked` (used by `flashKicker`). When `grantsFlashTiming = true` paying the cost unlocks instant-speed casting in addition to whatever else it does — the optional cost may be mana (Ghitu Fire: `KeywordAbility.flashKicker("{2}")`) **or** a non-mana `additionalCost` such as Behold (Molten Exhale: "you may cast this as though it had flash if you behold a Dragon", `KeywordAbility.flashKicker(Costs.additional.Behold(filter = Filters.WithSubtype("Dragon")))`). Prefer the factories: `KeywordAbility.kicker(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.kicker(additionalCost)`, `KeywordAbility.multikicker(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.offspring(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.flashKicker(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.flashKicker(additionalCost)`. Serial name is `Kicker` for wire compatibility. **Kicker {X}** (variable kicker, e.g. `KeywordAbility.kicker("{X}")` on Verdeloth the Ancient): the kicked cast surfaces `hasXCost`/`maxAffordableX` so the client prompts for X exactly like a base-cost X spell; the chosen X is paid as part of the kicker and stamped onto `SpellOnStackComponent.xValue`, so the card's ETB trigger reads it via `DynamicAmount.XValue` ("create X tokens").
- `Impending(time, cost)` — `card { impending(n, cost) }` builder helper (CR 702.175, Duskmourn). A self-alternative
  cost: pay [cost] instead of the mana cost and the permanent enters with N **time counters**, isn't a creature until
  the last is removed, and loses one at the beginning of your end step. The helper wires everything from one call — the
  `KeywordAbility.Impending` alt-cost (display + cast enumeration), a `ConditionalStaticAbility(RemoveCardType("CREATURE"),
  Conditions.SourceHasCounter(TIME))` "isn't a creature while it has a time counter" static, and a `YourEndStep`
  triggered ability (gated by the same intervening-if) that removes a time counter. The engine places the N TIME counters
  when a spell cast for its impending cost resolves; casting for the normal mana cost adds no counters, so neither wiring
  fires (mirrors `prowess()` / `rampage()`).
- `Sneak(cost)` — `card { sneak("{cost}") }` builder helper (CR 702.190, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). An
  alternative cost with a built-in **timing permission**: *"Any time you could cast an instant during your declare
  blockers step, you may cast this spell by paying [cost] and returning an unblocked creature you control to its owner's
  hand rather than paying this spell's mana cost."* A permanent spell whose sneak cost was paid enters **tapped and
  attacking** the same defender the returned creature was attacking (CR 702.190b). The helper just attaches the
  `KeywordAbility.Sneak` display marker; all behavior is in the engine: the dedicated `SneakCastEnumerator` surfaces a
  `CastWithAlternativeCost` (`AlternativeCostType.SNEAK`) only during the active player's declare blockers step while they
  control an unblocked attacker, with a `BouncePermanent` additional cost listing the returnable attackers; `CastSpellHandler`
  charges the sneak mana, returns the chosen attacker to hand, and stamps the sneak-was-paid flag; `StackResolver` enters a
  resolving permanent tapped and attacking. Read "its sneak cost was paid" via `Conditions.SneakCostWasPaid`.
- `Suspend` (CR 702.62) — an **exile-zone** mechanic, unlike Impending/Vanishing which live on the battlefield.
  A suspended card sits in exile with **time counters**; at the beginning of its **owner's** upkeep one is removed,
  and when the last is gone its owner **may play it for free**, with **haste** if it's a creature. The lifecycle is
  **component-driven**, not definition-driven: the engine grants `Suspend.countdownAbility` (a synthesized
  `activeZone = EXILE` upkeep trigger — remove a counter, then a `MayEffect` that gathers the card via
  `CardSource.Self` and casts it with `CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect`) to **any** exiled card carrying the
  `SuspendedComponent` marker. So an arbitrary card with no printed suspend can be suspended.
  - **Putting a card into suspend** is a chain you compose; `Effects.Suspend(target, timeCounters)` is the reusable
    two-step tail (`AddCounters(TIME, n)` + `GrantSuspendEffect` — the latter sets the marker **and** arms a dormant
    haste effect on the card with duration `WhileControlledByController`, so the haste ends the moment the player who
    played it loses control of the permanent — CR 702.62g). The caller supplies the exile step first, because it differs by source zone:
    a spell on the stack uses `CounterSpellToExile` / `CounterEffect(counterDestination = Exile())` (it can't be lifted
    off the stack with a zone-move); a printed `suspend N—[cost]` exiles from hand as its cast cost.
  - **Taigam, Master Opportunist** is the first user: `Composite(CopyTargetSpell(TriggeringEntity),
    CounterEffect(TriggeringEntity → Exile), Suspend(TriggeringEntity, 4))`.
- `Paradigm` (Secrets of Strixhaven) — `spell { effect = …; paradigm() }` on a Lesson spell. An **exile-zone
  recurrence** mechanic, modelled exactly like Suspend (a marker the engine reads off an exiled card), differing
  only in that it casts a **copy** rather than the card itself, so the original recurs forever. Oracle: "[effect]
  Then exile this spell. After you first resolve a spell with this name, you may cast a copy of it from exile
  without paying its mana cost at the beginning of each of your first main phases." `paradigm()` implies
  `selfExile()`: the spell exiles itself on resolution (reusing the `selfExileOnResolve` → `StackResolver` exile
  path) and is tagged with the `ParadigmComponent` marker as it lands in exile; the `Keyword.PARADIGM` display
  keyword is added automatically. The engine then grants `Paradigm.recastAbility` — a synthesized
  `activeZone = EXILE`, `StepEvent(PRECOMBAT_MAIN, You)` trigger whose `MayEffect` copies the card via
  `CopyCardIntoCollectionEffect(Self)` and casts it with `CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect` — to **any**
  exiled card carrying the marker (the marker is the gate: a Lesson exiled by some other path never recurs). The
  original stays in exile; each cast copy is a phantom that ceases to exist (CR 707.10a / 112.3b), so there is no
  exponential growth. The `Lesson` spell subtype (`Subtype.LESSON`) is a plain, non-functional subtype (no Learn
  mechanic in the set), but the type line must parse it.
- `Craft(filter, cost)` — `card { craft(filter, cost) }` builder helper (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of
  Ixalan). On the front face of a transforming DFC: "Craft with [filter] [cost] ([cost], Exile this permanent,
  Exile [filter] you control and/or [filter] cards from your graveyard: Return this card to the battlefield
  transformed under its owner's control. Activate only as a sorcery.)" Composes entirely from existing primitives
  — `AbilityCost.Composite(Mana(cost), AbilityCost.Craft(filter))` (the atomic `Craft` sub-cost handles both the
  self-exile and the materials-exile because CR 702.167a defines them as one paired clause), plus
  `Effects.ReturnSelfFromExileTransformed` as the resolution effect, and `timing = TimingRule.SorcerySpeed`.
  Records the exiled materials on the source's `CraftedFromExiledComponent` so the back face's CDA
  ("Mastercraft Raptor's power is equal to the total power of the exiled cards used to craft it", CR 702.167c)
  can read them via `DynamicAmount.CraftedMaterialsTotalPower`. Declares `Keyword.CRAFT` for display.

  Material selection: the engine surfaces the combined BF + GY candidate pool on each Craft activation as
  `AdditionalCostData.validCraftMaterials` / `craftMinCount`. The web client renders both zones side-by-side
  via the dedicated `CraftMaterialOverlay` (routed by the `Craft` cost-type branch in `pipelinePhases`) and
  submits the picked IDs back as `ActivateAbility.costPayment.exiledCards`. Headless / game-server callers can
  supply the chosen IDs directly. The cost handler validates that every chosen entity is either a permanent
  the activator controls or a card in their graveyard matching `filter`, and rejects activation when no
  choices are supplied (no silent auto-pick).

- `Renew(cost)` — `card { renew(cost) { effect = … } }` builder helper (Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Sultai clan keyword).
  A graveyard-activated ability: "Renew — [cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: [effect]. Activate only as a
  sorcery." The helper composes it entirely from existing primitives — `AbilityCost.Composite(Mana(cost), ExileSelf)`,
  `activateFromZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD`, and `timing = TimingRule.SorcerySpeed` — so no new engine subsystem is involved.
  The `renew { }` lambda configures the effect (and any targets via `target(name, requirement)`) exactly like
  `activatedAbility { }`; its `cost`/`timing`/`activateFromZone` fields are ignored (fixed by Renew). The
  `GraveyardAbilityEnumerator` surfaces the ability while the card is in the graveyard and only at sorcery speed; the
  `ActivateAbilityHandler` pays the mana and exiles the card from the graveyard. Declares `Keyword.RENEW` for display.
- `station()` — `card { station() }` builder helper (CR 702.184, Edge of Eternities; Spacecraft and Planet cards).
  Emits the fixed station keyword ability (CR 702.184a): "Tap another untapped creature you control: Put a number of
  charge counters on this permanent equal to the tapped creature's power. Activate only as a sorcery." The ability is
  fully fixed by the rules, so the helper takes no arguments — it builds
  `AbilityCost.TapPermanents(count = 1, filter = Creature, excludeSelf = true)` →
  `Effects.AddDynamicCounters(Counters.CHARGE, DynamicAmount.StationCharge, Self)` at `TimingRule.SorcerySpeed`. The
  charge amount is the dedicated `DynamicAmount.StationCharge` node (see §13), *not* a plain
  `EntityProperty(TappedAsCost, Power)` read, so the CR 702.184c "station using toughness" substitution
  (`StationUsingToughness`, Tapestry Warden) stays scoped to station abilities. What the card gains at each charge
  threshold (the `{N+}` station symbols, CR 721.2a) is authored separately per card — `staticAbility { }` rows for
  Spacecraft that grant `GrantKeyword(...)` / `GrantCardType("CREATURE", …)`, or threshold-gated activated abilities
  for Planets — each gated on `Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast(Counters.CHARGE, N)` (see §12). No dedicated
  `Keyword.STATION`: the layout/symbols are display-only and the ability is the whole mechanic.
  - **Multi-select activation shortcut.** Because the station ability has no chosen targets and its
    effect stacks, the player may station with several creatures in one gesture: the cost-selection
    UI lets them pick 1..N distinct untapped creatures and the engine queues one activation per
    creature on the stack (each taps exactly its creature and charges by *that* creature's power).
    This is a pure UX convenience over activating station repeatedly — the resulting state is
    identical to doing it one creature at a time — and is wired generically, not just for station:
    any single-creature (`count == 1`) `TapPermanents`-cost activated ability with no target
    requirements, a repeat-stacking effect, and no once-/max-per-turn restriction is offered the
    same batch. It rides the existing `ActivateAbility.repeatCount` batch-activation path; the
    server advertises the cap as `AdditionalCostInfo.tapBatchMaxActivations` (the count of legal tap
    targets) and `ActivateAbilityHandler` slices `costPayment.tappedPermanents` one creature per
    activation. Selecting a single creature is the unchanged single-station behaviour. (Saddle/Mount,
    by contrast, already taps any number of creatures within one activation — a different shape —
    so it is unaffected.)
- `Morph(cost)` — cast face-down for `{3}`, flip for cost.
- `Unmorph(cost, effect)` — turn-face-up cost + bonus effect.
- `Equip(cost)` — Equipment attach cost. The `equipAbility(cost, genericCostReduction = …)` DSL
  form optionally reduces the generic portion of the equip cost by a `DynamicAmount` evaluated at
  activation. Reductions that read the chosen equip target (e.g. `DynamicAmounts.targetColorCount()`
  for "costs {1} less to activate for each color of the creature it targets" — Dragonfire Blade)
  resolve against the picked target. Backed by `ActivatedAbility.genericCostReduction`: the
  `ActivateAbilityHandler` locks the per-target reduction in before paying; the legal-action
  enumerator gates affordability on the cheapest reachable cost (largest reduction over the
  currently-legal targets) since the target isn't chosen until activation. The synthesized ability
  carries `ActivatedAbility.isEquipAbility = true`, which the engine keys off for the equip-timing
  and free-first-equip permissions below.
- `Fortify(cost)` — Aura-like attach cost on lands.

## 12. Conditions (`Conditions.*`)

**One "entity matches a filter" primitive.** "Does *some entity* match a `GameObjectFilter`" is a
single condition — `EntityMatches(entity: EffectTarget, filter)` — that names *which* entity via the
shared `EffectTarget` vocabulary. It subsumes the four former near-clones; each is now a facade
helper over it:

| Helper | Desugars to |
|---|---|
| `Conditions.SourceMatches(f)` (and every `SourceIs*` / `SourceHas*`) | `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.Self, f)` |
| `Conditions.EnchantedPermanentMatches(f)` | `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.EnchantedPermanent, f)` |
| `Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter(f, i)` | `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(i), f)` |
| `Conditions.TriggeringSpellMatches(f)` | `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity, f)` |

The entity role fixes *when* the condition can be answered: `Self` and the enchanted/equipped
attachment roles evaluate in both resolution and static-ability projection; `ContextTarget` and
`TriggeringEntity` are resolution-only (false under projection). Use `Conditions.EntityMatches`
directly only for a role the helpers don't name (e.g. the equipped creature). It is deliberately
*not* a player check (`TargetIsPlayer`) nor a numeric/tracker check (`Compare`). Any other
`EffectTarget` role is rejected by the `CardLinter` at card load (§21) — the evaluator can't
answer it and would silently return `false`.

**Two anti-patterns to avoid when adding conditions:**

- **Tracker-shaped conditions route through `Compare` + a tracked amount**, not a new condition
  class. "You gained 3+ life this turn" is `Compare(TurnTracking(You, LIFE_GAINED), GTE, 3)`. When
  the tracker the comparison needs doesn't exist yet, add the *tracker enum value* (data) and reach
  for `Compare` — don't mint a bespoke `You…ThisTurn` condition.
- **Set-mechanic conditions are quarantined** in mechanic-named files (next to the mechanic's other
  SDK surface), never added to the general condition files. The `add-feature` checklist asks this
  placement question explicitly.

### Battlefield state

- `YouControl(filter, negate = false, excludeSelf = false)` — you control ≥1 matching permanent.
  Set `excludeSelf = true` for "another …" wording, which excludes the resolving source from the
  search (e.g. Splitskin Doll's "another creature with power 2 or less").
- `YouControlAtLeast(count, filter)` — you control `count` or more matching permanents (the
  filtered-count generalization of `ControlCreaturesAtLeast`/`ControlLandsAtLeast`; e.g.
  `YouControlAtLeast(3, GameObjectFilter.Creature.attacking())` for Stormbeacon Blade).
- `ControlCreature` — you control any creature.
- `NoCreaturesOnBattlefield` — there are no creatures anywhere on the battlefield (global, either player;
  `Exists(Player.Each, …, negate = true)`). Used by Drop of Honey's "when there are no creatures on the
  battlefield, sacrifice this enchantment" state trigger.
- `ControlMoreCreatures` — you control more creatures than each opponent.
- `OpponentControlsCreature` — at least one opponent has a creature.
- `OpponentControlsMoreCreatures` — an opponent outpaces you.
- `OpponentControlsMoreLands` — an opponent has more lands.
- `OpponentHasMoreCardsInHand` — an opponent has more cards in hand than you (compares opponents' hand size to yours). Used by Beza, the Bounding Spring and Joined Researchers.
- `OpponentControlsLandType(type)` — opponent controls land of a type.
- `CompareAmounts(left, operator, right)` — generic numeric comparison of two `DynamicAmount`s with a
  `ComparisonOperator.{LT,LTE,EQ,NEQ,GT,GTE}` (composes the underlying `Compare` condition). The facade
  entry point for any "if amount X (relation) amount Y" intervening-if or static gate. Used by Taii
  Wakeen, Perfect Shot's intervening-if: `CompareAmounts(ContextProperty(TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT), EQ,
  ContextProperty(TRIGGER_RECIPIENT_TOUGHNESS))`.
- `DifferentCounterKindsAtLeast(count, filter = Creature)` — true when `count` or more *different
  kinds* of counters are among permanents you control matching `filter` (default: creatures). A
  +1/+1 and a finality counter is two kinds; the same kind on several permanents counts once.
  Board-derived only, so it gates a `ConditionalStaticAbility` (evaluates identically in resolution
  and projection). Desugars to `Compare(AggregateBattlefield(You, filter, DISTINCT_COUNTER_TYPES),
  GTE, count)`. Used by Hundred-Battle Veteran ("three or more different kinds of counters among
  creatures you control").
- `CounterKindAmongYouControlAtLeast(count, counterType, filter)` — true when the *total* number of
  `counterType` counters (a `CounterTypeFilter`, e.g. `CounterTypeFilter.Named("lore")`, or `.Any`
  to total every kind) among permanents you control matching `filter` is at least `count`. Sums the
  kind across the whole group — three Sagas with one, two, and one lore counter total four.
  Board-derived only (gates a `ConditionalStaticAbility`; evaluates identically in resolution and
  projection). Desugars to `Compare(AggregateBattlefield(You, filter, SUM, counterType = …), GTE,
  count)`. Used by Tom Bombadil ("As long as there are four or more lore counters among Sagas you
  control, … hexproof and indestructible").
- `TriggeringEntityHadCounters` — intervening-if for dies/leaves triggers: true when the triggering
  entity had ≥1 counter of *any* kind on it the moment it left the battlefield (reads the last-known
  total counter count, CR 603.10 / 603.6c). Resolution-only. Pair with `Triggers.YourCreatureDies` +
  `Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters` for "whenever this or another creature you control dies, if it
  had counters on it, move its counters" (Host of the Hereafter). Companion to the existing
  `TriggeringEntityHadMinusOneMinusOneCounter` (which checks only -1/-1 counters, e.g. Retched Wretch).
- `TargetControlsCreature(target)` — target player has a creature.
- `TargetControlsLand(target)` — target player has a land.
- `TargetMatchesFilter(filter, targetIndex = 0)` — the context target matches a `GameObjectFilter`.
  Resolution-only; backed by `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(targetIndex), filter)`.
- `TargetIsPlayer(targetIndex = 0)` — the context target is a player (not a permanent/spell/card).
  `TargetMatchesFilter` matches only game objects and returns false for a player target, so this is
  the dedicated check for "any target" effects with a player-only follow-up. Used by Sonic Shrieker
  ("If a player is dealt damage this way, they discard a card"); pair with
  `EffectTarget.ContextTarget(index)` to make that same player the subject of the follow-up.
- `TargetIsTapped(targetIndex = 0)` — the context target resolves to a tapped battlefield permanent.
  Non-permanent targets and permanents no longer on the battlefield return false. Branch on a target's
  tapped state at resolution via `ConditionalEffect` — used by Shackle Slinger ("If it's tapped, put a
  stun counter on it. Otherwise, tap it.").
- `TargetIsSource(targetIndex = 0)` — the context target resolves to the ability's own source
  permanent. Wrap in `Conditions.Not(...)` for "another"/"a different permanent" wordings — used by
  Arid Archway ("If another Desert was returned this way, surveil 1": `All(TargetMatchesFilter(Desert
  land), Not(TargetIsSource()))` checks the chosen land *before* the bounce, so returning the Archway
  itself doesn't count).
- `IfTargetTookExcessDamage(targetIndex = 0)` — true post-damage when the target creature's marked
  damage strictly exceeds its (projected) toughness. Chain after `Effects.DealDamage` in a composite
  so the marked-damage update applies before the condition reads it. Used by Orbital Plunge ("If
  excess damage was dealt this way, create a Lander token"). Semantics caveat: the read is
  `marked > toughness` regardless of which preceding step dealt the damage — Composite doesn't
  interleave SBA or fire triggers mid-chain, so for the canonical "deal N, then check" pipeline
  this is equivalent to "did the preceding step deal excess". A chain that deals damage in
  multiple steps within the same composite would see cumulative damage; reach for a different
  condition there. Defensive guards return false for non-creature targets and targets no longer
  on the battlefield (unreachable under `Targets.Creature` + Composite, retained for future
  callers).
- `TargetSharesMostCommonColor(targetIndex = 0)` — the context target shares a color with the
  most common color among all permanents, or a color tied for most common. Tallies each of the
  five colors across every battlefield permanent (multicolored permanents count once per color,
  using projected colors), takes the highest tally, and checks whether the target has any color
  in that (possibly tied) most-common set. A board with no colored permanents is `false`. Used by
  Tsabo's Assassin.
- `ColorIsMostCommon(color)` — the self-gating sibling of the above: true when `color` is the most
  common color among all permanents, or tied for most common (same tally rules). Board-derived
  only — no targets/triggering/kicker — so it evaluates identically in resolution and in
  projection, which lets it gate a `ConditionalStaticAbility`. Used by the Invasion djinn cycle
  ("as long as [color] is the most common color among all permanents…" — Goham/Halam/Ruham/Sulam/Zanam).
- `AnotherPermanentWithSameNameAsTarget(targetIndex = 0)` — true when at least one *other*
  battlefield permanent shares the exact card name of the context target at `targetIndex`. The
  target itself is excluded, so a lone copy never satisfies its own check; tokens compare by name
  like any other permanent. Resolution-only (reads a chosen target). Used by Winnow ("Destroy
  target nonland permanent if another permanent with the same name is on the battlefield").
- `EnchantedPermanentMatches(filter)` — true when the permanent the source Aura is attached to
  matches a `GameObjectFilter` (color, type, etc.), evaluated in projected state via the Aura's
  `AttachedToComponent`. General-purpose counterpart to the narrow `EnchantedCreatureIsLegendary` /
  `EnchantedCreatureHasSubtype` conditions. Backed by
  `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.EnchantedPermanent, filter)`; works as a `ConditionalStaticAbility`
  gate (also in the trigger resolver for conditionally-granted abilities). Used by Essence Leak ("as
  long as enchanted permanent is red or green…", `GameObjectFilter.Permanent.withAnyColor(Color.RED,
  Color.GREEN)`).
- `YouHaveCitysBlessing` — you have City's Blessing (10+ permanents).
- `SourceIsRingBearer` — the source permanent is your Ring-bearer (CR 701.54e).
- `YouChoseOtherCreatureAsRingBearer` — intervening-if for `Triggers.RingTemptsYou` payoffs that fire
  only when the controller chose a Ring-bearer other than the source (CR 701.54a). True iff the
  controller currently has a Ring-bearer designated AND that bearer isn't the source — so it's false
  both when the source itself was chosen and when the controller had no creature to choose. Used by
  Aragorn (Company Leader), Faramir (Field Commander), Gandalf (Friend of the Shire), and Galadriel
  of Lothlórien.
- `RingHasTemptedYouAtLeast(times)` — the Ring has tempted you `times` or more times this game
  (CR 701.54). Reads the cumulative `temptCount` on your The Ring emblem; a player never tempted
  counts as 0. Works at resolution and as an intervening-if. Used by Frodo, Sauron's Bane's granted
  Rogue ability ("that player loses the game if the Ring has tempted you four or more times this
  game"). Backed by `RingHasTemptedPlayerAtLeast(times, Player.You)`.

### Life & damage

- `LifeAtLeast(n, player?)` — player has ≥N life.
- `LifeAtMost(n, player?)` — player has ≤N life.
- `APlayerLifeAtMost(n)` — *some* player in the game has ≤N life (existential over `state.turnOrder`; distinct from `LifeAtMost`, which is `Player.You`). Used by enters-tapped-unless lands like Razortrap Gorge.
- `YouLostLife` — you lost life this turn.
- `OpponentLostLife` — an opponent lost life this turn.
- `YouGainedLifeThisTurn` — you gained ≥1 life this turn (intervening-if / static gate; backed by the
  `LIFE_GAINED` turn tracker). Used by Ulna Alley Shopkeep's Infusion buff.
- `YouGainedLifeThisTurnAtLeast(n)` — you gained ≥`n` life this turn. The threshold form of
  `YouGainedLifeThisTurn` (`Compare(TurnTracking(You, LIFE_GAINED), GTE, n)`). Used by Scheming
  Silvertongue's "if you gained 2 or more life this turn" prepared trigger.

### Cast / cost

- `WasCast` — source was cast (not put onto the stack).
- `TriggeringEntityWasCast` — the *triggering* entity (not the ability's source) was cast — i.e. it
  carries a cast-origin marker (`CastFromHandComponent` / `CastFromGraveyardComponent`). The
  cast-subject sibling of `WasCast`, for "whenever a creature you control enters, **if you cast it**,
  …" intervening-if triggers where the source is a separate permanent and the cast subject is the
  entering creature. Tokens, reanimated permanents, and "put onto the battlefield" permanents lack
  the markers and are correctly excluded. Used by **The Sibsig Ceremony** (a plain `WasCast` there
  would test the enchantment, not the entering creature). Resolution-only.
- `WasCastFromHand` — cast specifically from hand.
- `WasCastFromZone(zone)` — cast from a specific zone. For resolving spells it reads the spell's
  cast-origin; for a permanent already on the battlefield it falls back to the cast-origin marker
  stamped as it entered (`HAND` → `CastFromHandComponent`, `GRAVEYARD` → `CastFromGraveyardComponent`),
  so it can gate an entering permanent's own replacement effect (Hundred-Battle Veteran: "enters with
  a finality counter if cast from your graveyard").
- `WasKicked` — cast with kicker / multikicker / offspring (i.e. an `OptionalAdditionalCost` with `branchesEffect = true` whose extra cost was paid). FlashKicker payments are intentionally invisible to this condition.
- `SneakCostWasPaid` — the source was cast for its `Sneak` cost (CR 702.190 — mana + returning an unblocked attacker). Reads the durable `ChoiceSlot.SNEAK` flag on a resolved permanent, falling back to the resolution context for a non-permanent spell's own effect. Backs riders like Leonardo, Leader in Blue and The Last Ronin's Technique.
- `NoManaSpentToCast` — "it wasn't cast or no mana was spent to cast it": the standard free-cast
  payoff clause (**Freestrider Commando**, **Satoru, the Infiltrator**). True when the *total* mana
  spent to put the source onto the battlefield was zero — it was put onto the battlefield without
  being cast (reanimation, token, "put onto the battlefield"), **or** it was cast for free / for
  `{0}` (e.g. a plotted card cast from exile). False if any mana was spent, including mana paid for
  additional costs or cost increases on an otherwise-free cast (per the Freestrider Commando ruling:
  a plotted spell taxed by Aven Interrupter had mana spent, so it does not qualify). Reads the
  source's cast-mana record (`CastRecordComponent`), which the engine only stamps when mana > 0 was
  spent, so its absence (or a zero total) is exactly "no mana was spent." This single condition
  covers the whole oracle clause; compose `All(WasCast, NoManaSpentToCast)` for the narrower
  "cast, but for free" sense that excludes uncast permanents. Pairs naturally with the conditional
  `EntersWithCounters(..., condition = Conditions.NoManaSpentToCast)`. Resolution-only.
- `NoManaSpentToCastEntered` — the batch-enters variant of `NoManaSpentToCast`: "if none of them were
  cast or no mana was spent to cast them." Evaluated at resolution over the permanents a batch-enters
  trigger captured (the `Triggers.OneOrMorePermanentsEnter` batch, exposed as the `trigger.captured`
  pipeline collection), it's true iff **every** captured permanent had no mana spent to cast it (an empty
  capture is vacuously true). Use as a resolution-time `ConditionalEffect` gate on the payoff — **Satoru,
  the Infiltrator**: `ConditionalEffect(Conditions.NoManaSpentToCastEntered, Effects.DrawCards(1))` under a
  `Triggers.OneOrMorePermanentsEnter(GameObjectFilter.Creature.nontoken())` trigger. Resolution-only.
- `TriggeringSpellCastWithoutPayingMana` — triggering-entity counterpart of `NoManaSpentToCast`: "if no
  mana was spent to cast it" about the *triggering* spell (reads its `CastRecordComponent`). Used as a
  triggered-ability intervening-if (Boromir, Warden of the Tower: "Whenever an opponent casts a spell,
  if no mana was spent to cast it, counter that spell" → pair with `Effects.CounterTriggeringSpell()`).
- `BlightWasPaid(amount)` — the Blight X additional cost was paid.

### Source state

All "source matches X" conditions desugar to `Conditions.SourceMatches(filter)`, the facade over
`EntityMatches(EffectTarget.Self, filter)` — a generic predicate check against the source entity
that works in both resolution and static-ability (projection) contexts.

- `SourceMatches(filter)` — source entity matches a `GameObjectFilter`
  (`EntityMatches(EffectTarget.Self, filter)`).
- `SourceIsAttacking` — source is attacking.
- `SourceIsBlocking` — source is blocking.
- `SourceIsBlockingOrBlockedBySubtype(listOf(subtype, …))` — the source is currently in a combat
  pairing with a creature of one of the given subtypes — i.e. it is blocking, or being blocked by,
  at least one creature whose projected subtypes match any of them. "It" is resolved through the
  source: an Equipment/Aura reads its attached creature (so the condition gates a static ability
  granted to the equipped creature); a creature source uses itself. Checks both combat directions
  (`BlockingComponent` + `BlockedComponent`); partner subtypes use projected state. Works under
  static-ability projection, so a conditionally-granted keyword (e.g. first strike) is honored when
  combat damage is assigned. Used by Sting, the Glinting Dagger (LTR): "Equipped creature has first
  strike as long as it's blocking or blocked by a Goblin or Orc."
- `SourceIsTapped` — source is tapped.
- `SourceIsUntapped` — source is untapped.
- `SourceEnteredThisTurn` — source entered the battlefield this turn.
- `SourceIsSaddled` — source is saddled (CR 702.171b). Gates Mount payoffs on "while saddled" /
  "as long as it's saddled"; evaluates identically at resolution and during projection.
- `SourceAttackedThisTurn` — source was declared as an attacker at least once during the
  current turn (per-creature, derived from the controller's `PlayerAttackersThisTurnComponent`).
  Negate via `Conditions.Not(...)` for Erg Raiders-style "if it didn't attack this turn".
- `SourceHasDealtDamage` — source has dealt damage since entering the battlefield.
- `SourceHasDealtCombatDamageToPlayer` — saboteur-style payoff gate.
- `SourceIsModified` — has counters, attached Equipment, or controller-owned Aura
  attached (CR 700.4). Kept as a dedicated condition because the controller-of-Aura
  match isn't expressible via the generic `EntityMatches` filter machinery.
- `SourceReceivedCounterThisTurn` — "if you put a counter on this creature this turn." True while the source
  carries the per-turn `ReceivedCountersThisTurnComponent` marker (stamped by the counter-placement path, cleared
  at cleanup). Distinct from `SourceHasCounter` (which checks current counters): this fires even if the counter was
  later removed, and stays false if the source merely entered with counters from a *prior* turn. Used as the
  end-step intervening-if of Secrets of Strixhaven's Fractal Tender.
- `SourceHasSubtype(subtype)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(...))`;
  Changeling is honored.
- `SourceHasKeyword(keyword)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any.withKeyword(...))`.
- `SourceHasCounter(counterType)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any` with the
  corresponding `StatePredicate.HasCounter` / `HasAnyCounter`).
- `SourceCounterCountAtLeast(counterType, count)` — the threshold form of `SourceHasCounter`: the source has `count`+
  counters of `counterType` (a `Compare` on `EntityProperty(Source, CounterCount(Named(type)))`). This is the gate
  behind a Station card's `{N+}` symbol (CR 721.2a — "As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it,
  it has [abilities]"): use it as the `condition` of a `staticAbility { }` or inside
  `ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition(...)`, with `Counters.CHARGE`. Generic over counter type, reads counters live.

### Turn / phase

- `IsYourTurn` — it's your turn.
- `IsNotYourTurn` — it's an opponent's turn.
- `IsInPhase(phase)` — currently in `BEGINNING | MAIN | COMBAT | …`.
- `IsInStep(steps, yoursOnly = true)` — current step is one of `steps` (e.g. `Step.END`). Board-derived
  (reads `state.step` + active player), so it evaluates identically at resolution and under projection,
  making it usable as a `ConditionalStaticAbility` gate. `yoursOnly` requires it to be the controller's
  turn ("during your end step"). Used by Zurgo, Thunder's Decree.
- `ControllerTurnsTakenAtMost(n)` — the controller has taken at most N turns so far
  (1-indexed once they're partway through their first turn). Reads
  `PlayerTurnsTakenComponent` set by `TurnManager.startTurn`. Used by Starting Town
  ("your first, second, or third turn of the game" → `n = 3`).

### Per-turn counts

All three are parameterised by a `Player` reference (default `Player.You`), so they
work in both resolution and static-ability (projection) contexts. The DSL helpers
default to "you" so card authors don't need to pass it explicitly.

- `YouAttackedWithCreaturesThisTurn(filter, atLeast)` — Raid/Battalion shape. Backed by
  `PlayerAttackedWithCreaturesThisTurn(Player.You, filter, atLeast)`.
- `PlayerAttackedPlayerThisTurn(attacker, defender = Player.You)` — whether `attacker` "attacked"
  `defender` this turn (CR 508.6): they declared one or more attackers whose defending player was
  `defender` (the player directly, or the controller of a planeswalker / protector of a battle the
  attacker was attacking, CR 508.5). Reads the attacker's per-turn `PlayerAttackedPlayersThisTurnComponent`
  (stamped at declare-attackers, cleared at end of turn). Negate with `Not(...)` for "didn't attack you
  that turn" (Faramir, Prince of Ithilien: at the chosen opponent's next end step, draw if they didn't
  attack you, else make three Human Soldier tokens). `attacker` is typically `Player.TriggeringPlayer`
  (the player a delayed trigger fired on via `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.fireOnPlayer`).
- `YouCastSpellsThisTurn(atLeast, filter, fromZone?)` — Prowess/Magecraft shape. Backed by
  `PlayerCastSpellsThisTurn(Player.You, filter, atLeast, fromZone)`. `fromZone` (default any) restricts
  the count to spells cast from that zone, matched independently of `filter` (a face-down/morph spell
  cast from hand still counts, CR 708.2). With `fromZone = Zone.HAND`, negating gives the Prairie Dog
  cycle's "you haven't cast a spell from your hand this turn":
  `Not(YouCastSpellsThisTurn(1, fromZone = Zone.HAND))` (Inventive Wingsmith, Prairie Dog, Canyon Crab,
  Emergent Haunting, Wrangler of the Damned). The origin zone is captured on each `CastSpellRecord`
  (`castFromZone`) at cast time, so flashback/forage (GRAVEYARD), plot/foretell (EXILE), and commander
  (COMMAND) casts are all distinguished from hand casts.
- `YouDrewCardsThisTurn(atLeast = 1)` — "as long as you've drawn N or more cards this turn".
  Backed by `PlayerDrewCardsThisTurn(Player.You, atLeast)`, which reads the per-player
  `CardsDrawnThisTurnComponent` (reset for all players at turn start). Works in resolution and
  cost-reduction (projection) contexts. Used by Gwaihir the Windlord ("costs {2} less … as long as
  you've drawn two or more cards this turn") via `ModifySpellCost(..., gating = CostGating.OnlyIf(...))`.
- `TriggeringSpellMatches(filter)` — intervening-if guard: the spell that triggered this ability
  matches `filter`. Reads the triggering entity's static card characteristics (so it stays correct
  after the spell leaves the stack). General "whenever you cast a spell, if it's a/an X ..." gate.
  Backed by `EntityMatches(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity, filter)`.
- `YouCastFirstSpellOfTypeThisTurn(filter)` — true when the triggering spell is the *first* spell
  matching `filter` you've cast this turn. Pure composition, no bespoke counting:
  `All(TriggeringSpellMatches(filter), Not(YouCastSpellsThisTurn(atLeast = 2, filter)))`. The
  `TriggeringSpellMatches` half is load-bearing — it stops a later non-matching cast from satisfying
  the count once one matching spell exists. Used by Alania, Divergent Storm (first instant / first
  sorcery / first Otter).
- `YouCommittedCrimeThisTurn` — Outlaws of Thunder Junction crime gate: true once you've cast a
  spell, activated an ability, or put a triggered ability on the stack this turn that targets an
  opponent, anything an opponent controls, and/or a card in an opponent's graveyard. Backed by
  `PlayerCommittedCrimeThisTurn(Player.You)`, which reads `GameState.playersWhoCommittedCrimeThisTurn`
  — a turn-scoped set populated at every `CommitCrimeEvent` emit site (crime detection is the engine's
  `CrimeDetector`) and cleared at each turn boundary. Stays true for the rest of the turn even if the
  crime-committing spell/ability is countered. Resolves identically in resolution and projection (e.g.
  cost-reduction) contexts. Pairs with `CostGating.OnlyIf(...)` for "costs {N} less if you've committed
  a crime this turn" (Seize the Secrets).
- `YouHaveCitysBlessing` — Ascend gate. Backed by `PlayerHasCitysBlessing(Player.You)`.
- `IsFirstSpellPaidWithTreasureManaCastThisTurn` — gates a triggered ability to fire only
  on the first spell each turn that mana from a Treasure was spent to cast (Rain of
  Riches). Reads `CastSpellRecord.paidWithTreasureMana` on the per-player spell history.
- `PermanentTypeEnteredBattlefieldThisTurn(cardType, player = Player.You)` — true if a
  permanent of `cardType` entered the battlefield under `player`'s control at any point
  this turn. Pure ETB tracker: the permanent need not still be on the battlefield, still
  be of that type, or still be under the same controller — only the entry event matters
  (so Mechan Shieldmate's "as long as an artifact entered ... this turn" stays satisfied
  even if the artifact is destroyed before combat). Captured types are read from the
  *projected* state at the moment of entry, so a permanent that's an artifact via a
  continuous effect at ETB (Mycosynth Lattice, etc.) also counts. Backed by the per-player
  `PermanentTypesEnteredBattlefieldThisTurnComponent`, cleared by `CleanupPhaseManager` at
  end of turn. Every battlefield entry must go through `BattlefieldEntry.place` for this
  tracker to stay in sync. Shortcut: `Conditions.ArtifactEnteredBattlefieldThisTurn`.
- `YouDescendedThisTurn(atLeast = 1)` — CR 700.11 gate: at least `atLeast` nontoken
  permanent cards were put into your graveyard from *any* zone this turn (battlefield,
  hand, library, stack, exile). Tokens do not count, even though they briefly enter the
  graveyard before ceasing to exist; instants and sorceries do not count. The cards
  themselves need not still be in the graveyard when the gate evaluates — the count is a
  pure event tracker. Composes through `Compare(DynamicAmount.TurnTracking(Player.You,
  TurnTracker.DESCENDED), GTE, Fixed(atLeast))`, so the same plumbing supports the bare
  descend gate (`atLeast = 1`, Ruin-Lurker Bat: "At the beginning of your end step, if
  you descended this turn, scry 1") and the descend N / fathomless descent ability words
  (`atLeast = 4`, `atLeast = 8`). Backed by the per-player
  `PlayerDescendedThisTurnComponent`, incremented in `ZoneTransitionService` whenever a
  permanent (nontoken) card lands in a player's graveyard, and cleared by
  `CleanupPhaseManager` at end of turn.
- `GraveyardContains(filter)` — "there is at least one card matching `filter` in your graveyard"
  (`Exists(Player.You, Zone.GRAVEYARD, filter)`). Compose with `Conditions.All`/`Any` for multi-type
  checks, e.g. `All(GraveyardContains(Filters.Instant), GraveyardContains(Filters.Sorcery))` =
  "an instant card and a sorcery card in your graveyard" (Flow State). `GraveyardContainsSubtype(subtype)`
  is the subtype-filtered sibling.
- `Delirium(count = 4)` — the Delirium ability word: "there are `count` or more card types among
  cards in your graveyard." Composes through `Compare(DynamicAmount.AggregateZone(Player.You,
  Zone.GRAVEYARD, GameObjectFilter.Any, Aggregation.DISTINCT_TYPES), GTE, Fixed(count))` — the
  distinct-card-type count over your graveyard (artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, instant,
  land, planeswalker, sorcery); a single card with several types contributes each type once. The
  printed threshold is always four, but `count` is parameterized. Works as a static "as long as …"
  gate (`staticAbility { ability = ModifyStats(...); condition = Conditions.Delirium() }` —
  Spineseeker Centipede) and as an activated-ability `ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition`
  ("Activate only if there are four or more card types …" — Balustrade Wurm).
- `CreatureDiedThisTurn` — intervening-if "if a creature died this turn", **global** (any player's
  control; sums every player's `CreaturesDiedThisTurnComponent`).
- `ControlledCreatureDiedThisTurn` — intervening-if "if a creature died **under your control** this
  turn", scoped to the source's controller (reads only that player's `CreaturesDiedThisTurnComponent`).
  Used by Barrensteppe Siege (Mardu). Dual-mode.
- `YouHadPermanentLeaveBattlefieldThisTurn` — intervening-if "if a permanent you controlled left
  the battlefield this turn". Per-player, scoped to the source's controller. Counts every permanent
  type (creatures, lands, artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers) and includes tokens — broader
  than `ControlledCreatureDiedThisTurn`. Backed by `PermanentLeftBattlefieldThisTurnComponent`,
  incremented by `ZoneTransitionService` whenever a permanent leaves the battlefield, credited to
  its last-known controller. Used by Shortcut to Mushrooms (LTR). Dual-mode.
- `SacrificedHadSubtype(subtype)` — intervening-if "if an X was sacrificed this way". Reads
  `EffectContext.sacrificedPermanents` snapshots captured at cost/effect-time (cost-payment or
  edict-sacrifice both populate the same list). Used by Thallid Omnivore (DOM).
- `SacrificedWasLegendary` — intervening-if "if the sacrificed creature was legendary". Same
  snapshot path as `SacrificedHadSubtype`, but reads `supertypes` instead of subtypes. Used by
  Nasty End and Gríma Wormtongue (LTR).
- `YouSacrificedThisWay` — intervening-if "if you sacrificed a creature this way". Filters
  `EffectContext.sacrificedPermanents` for snapshots whose last-known controller is the source's
  controller — the gate on the personal half of a symmetric edict. Used by Rise of the Witch-king
  (LTR). The companion `CardSource.FromZone(..., excludeSacrificedThisWay = true)` drops those same
  snapshotted entities from a later gather, so "return **another** permanent card …" can't offer the
  permanent you just sacrificed to the same spell.

### Composition

- `All(c1, c2, ...)` — AND.
- `Any(c1, c2, ...)` — OR.
- `Not(c)` — negate.
- `Compare(v1, op, v2)` — numeric comparison between `DynamicAmount`s.
- `Exists(player, zone, filter)` — at least one matching object exists.

To gate a spell-cost reduction on a condition, use `CostGating.OnlyIf(condition)` on the
`ModifySpellCost` ability (see **Spell cost statics**) rather than baking the condition into the
reduction amount.

### Static-ability vs resolution-time evaluation

Every `Condition` works in both contexts: at spell/trigger resolution (full
`EffectContext` — targets, kicker, triggering entity, etc.) and during state projection
inside a `ConditionalStaticAbility` (only the source entity and projected values are
known). The engine dispatches via a `ConditionEvaluationContext.Resolution` /
`Projection` sealed type — there is **no** separate `SourceProjectionCondition` arm.

Conditions that need resolution-only facts (e.g. `TargetMatchesFilter`, `TargetSharesMostCommonColor`, `TriggeringEntity*`,
`WasKicked`, `ManaSpentToCastIncludes`, `CollectionContainsMatch`) silently evaluate to
`false` under projection — a static-ability gate is never "in the middle of casting a spell".

Other gates available in both contexts:

- `ColorIsMostCommon(color)` — board-derived, so it gates a `ConditionalStaticAbility` directly
  (the Invasion djinns rely on this).
- `SourceChosenModeIs("id")` — gate on the chosen mode (Sieges / `EntersWithChoice`). Works at both
  resolution and projection.
- `CastChoiceMade(slot)` — generic "was a value locked into this `ChoiceSlot`" guard over the durable
  cast-choices bag (mtgish's `AColorWasChosen`): `CastChoiceMade(ChoiceSlot.COLOR)`,
  `CastChoiceMade(ChoiceSlot.KICKED)`. Works at resolution and projection.
- `CastChoiceIs(slot, "value")` — the slot's value equals `value` (text compare; color compares against
  the enum name): `CastChoiceIs(ChoiceSlot.MODE, "Khans")`, `CastChoiceIs(ChoiceSlot.COLOR, "RED")`. The
  generic slot reader new cards should prefer over per-slot conditions; the §8 emitter target for
  mtgish's `TheChosenColor`/`TheChosenCreatureType` guards.
- `CapturedAtCast("flag")` — the named **"as you cast this spell"** condition capture (CR 601.2i) was
  true the moment the spell was cast. Pairs with the spell DSL `captureAtCast("flag", condition)`: the
  engine evaluates `condition` (caster as controller) as the spell finishes being cast and freezes the
  names whose condition held onto `SpellOnStackComponent.castTimeFlags`; this reads the frozen answer at
  resolution, so a later board change can't flip the branch. Distinct from the player-choice slot guards
  above — those read what the player *chose*, this reads whether a game condition *held*. Used by Steer
  Clear ("deals 4 damage instead if you controlled a Mount as you cast this spell"):

  ```kotlin
  spell {
      captureAtCast("controlledMount", Conditions.ControlCreatureOfType(Subtype("Mount")))
      val creature = target("target", TargetPermanent(filter = TargetFilter.AttackingOrBlockingCreature))
      effect = ConditionalEffect(
          condition = Conditions.CapturedAtCast("controlledMount"),
          effect = Effects.DealDamage(4, creature),
          elseEffect = Effects.DealDamage(2, creature),
      )
  }
  ```

**Cast-choice slots (`ChoiceSlot`).** The choices an object locks in *as it is cast / as it enters*
(CR 601.2b) — color, creature type, land type, mode, chosen creature, kicked-ness, blight amount — all
ride one durable `CastChoicesComponent` on the stable entity (the immutable-ECS analogue of Forge's
SVar bag). `{X}` has its own dedicated reader (`DynamicAmount.CastX`); the other slots are read
generically via `DynamicAmount.CastChoice(slot)` (numeric), `CastChoiceMade(slot)` / `CastChoiceIs(slot,
value)` (conditions), or consumed directly by effects (e.g. `Effects.CreateTokenOfChosenColorAndType`).

---

## 13. Dynamic amounts (`DynamicAmount.*`)

Numbers computed at resolution time.

### Math

- `Fixed(n)` — literal constant.
- `XValue` — the X chosen for the spell/ability, read from the transient resolution context. Populated
  only while the spell/ability itself is resolving — an ETB trigger or a later activated ability can't
  see it. Use `CastX` for the durable, object-scoped reading.
- `CastX` — the `{X}` this object was cast with, read off the *current object* regardless of zone, so it
  survives onto the permanent. The same X feeds a "when you cast this spell" trigger, an enters-the-
  battlefield trigger, the enters-with-counters replacement, and a later activated ability — the analogue
  of mtgish's `ValueX` / `Trigger_ValueXOfThatSpell`. Backed by a durable `CastChoicesComponent` that
  rides the spell's stable entity onto the battlefield (and `SpellOnStackComponent.xValue` while still on
  the stack); preserved as last-known information for dies/leaves triggers. A copy of a *permanent*
  (Clone) does not inherit it (CR 707.2); a copy of a *spell* on the stack does. Hydroid Krasis reads
  `CastX` for both its cast trigger ("draw half X") and its enters-with-X-counters replacement.
- `CastChoice(slot)` — the *numeric* value locked into a `ChoiceSlot` as this object was cast, read off
  the same durable `CastChoicesComponent` as `CastX` (falling back to the resolution context, so an
  instant/sorcery that never becomes a permanent still resolves it). The only numeric slot today is
  `ChoiceSlot.BLIGHT_AMOUNT` — the X declared for a `blight X` additional cost (Soul Immolation "deals X
  damage…"). Non-numeric slots (color, creature type, mode) are read by the `CastChoiceMade` /
  `CastChoiceIs` conditions or consumed directly by effects, not by `DynamicAmount`. (Replaces the old
  `ContextProperty(ADDITIONAL_COST_BLIGHT_AMOUNT)`.)
- `TotalManaSpent` — total mana paid from the pool to cast the current spell (sum of every per-color
  bucket; for X spells the X portion is included). E.g. Memory Deluge "where X is the mana spent."
- `ManaSpentOnX(color)` — the amount of `{color}` mana spent on the `{X}` portion specifically, broken
  down by color. Used by payoffs that scale with how much of a color went into X — Soul Burn ("you gain
  life equal to the amount of black mana spent on X"). Pair with `xManaRestriction` (see below) so the X
  can only be paid with the relevant colors.
- `DistinctColorsManaSpent` — the number of distinct *colors* of mana spent to cast the source spell
  (0–5), counting how many of the W/U/B/R/G payment buckets are non-zero. Colorless is not a color
  (CR 105.1) and never counts; mana spent on `{X}` and on generic costs still has its color counted.
  Backs the **Converge** ability word and the classic **Sunburst** rule. Resolves off the source
  entity's recorded payment (live `SpellOnStackComponent` while on the stack, the resolved permanent's
  `CastRecordComponent` afterward), so it reads correctly both at resolution and as the permanent enters
  (the common use: feeding `EntersWithDynamicCounters`). Facade: `DynamicAmounts.colorsOfManaSpent()`.
  A permanent put onto the battlefield without being cast spent no mana, so this is 0 for it.
- `Add(a, b)` — `a + b`.
- `Subtract(a, b)` — `a − b`.
- `Multiply(a, b)` — `a × b`.
- `Power(base, exponent)` — `base^exponent` with a fixed integer `base` and a dynamic `exponent`; saturates at the global quantity cap. A non-positive exponent yields `1` (`x⁰ = 1`). Used for "draws 2ˣ cards" (Mathemagics: `Power(2, XValue)`).
- `Divide(a, b, roundUp?)` — division with rounding rule.
- `Min(a, b)` — minimum.
- `Max(a, b)` — maximum.
- `Absolute(a)` — `|a|`.

### Battlefield aggregation

- `AggregateBattlefield(player, filter, aggregation?, property?, counterType?)` — aggregate over
  matching permanents. `aggregation` defaults to `COUNT`; other modes: `MAX`/`MIN`/`SUM` over a
  `property` (`POWER`/`TOUGHNESS`/`MANA_VALUE`), and the distinct-set counters
  `DISTINCT_TYPES`, `DISTINCT_COLORS`, `DISTINCT_NAMES`, `DISTINCT_BASIC_LAND_SUBTYPES`
  (Domain), `DISTINCT_COUNTER_TYPES` (the number of different kinds of counters present
  across the group — same kind on several permanents counts once), and `DISTINCT_VALUES`
  (the number of *distinct values* of the configured `property` — Selvala, Eager Trailblazer's
  "the number of different powers among creatures you control" via
  `aggregation = DISTINCT_VALUES, property = POWER`; two permanents sharing a value count once).
  Builder shortcut: `DynamicAmounts.battlefield(player, filter).distinctValues(CardNumericProperty.POWER)`.
  `DISTINCT_NAMES` counts *differently named* matched permanents (two sharing a name count once) —
  "the number of differently named lands you control" (Emil, Vastlands Roamer) via
  `DynamicAmounts.battlefield(Player.You, GameObjectFilter.Land).distinctNames()`.
  `excludeSelf = true` drops the aggregate's own source/affected entity ("among *other* …"), e.g.
  Loot, the Key to Everything's "the number of card types among other nonland permanents you control"
  (`filter = GameObjectFilter.NonlandPermanent, aggregation = DISTINCT_TYPES, excludeSelf = true`).
  `DISTINCT_TYPES` counts only true **card types** (CR 205.2a: Artifact/Creature/Enchantment/…), never
  supertypes or subtypes, while still honoring projection-changed types (an animated land that became a
  Creature counts as a Creature).
  When `counterType` (a `CounterTypeFilter`) is set with `SUM`/`MAX`/`MIN`, the per-permanent value
  aggregated is the count of *that kind* of counter on it — i.e. "the total <kind> counters among
  <filter>" (Tom Bombadil's lore-counter total; reach for it via
  `Conditions.CounterKindAmongYouControlAtLeast`). `CounterTypeFilter.Any` totals every kind. Counters
  are read from base state (layer-independent).
- `AggregateZone(player, zone, filter?, aggregation?)` — count cards in a zone.
- `CountPermanentsOfType(player, subtype)` — count by creature type.
- `CountCreaturesYouControl` — shorthand for "your creatures".
- Facades: `DynamicAmounts.cardsInYourGraveyard()` / `creatureCardsInYourGraveyard()`
  (graveyard counts), and `DynamicAmounts.cardsInYourHand()` — cards in your hand,
  e.g. Stingerback Terror's "-1/-1 for each card in your hand" (multiply by `-1` and feed
  both bonuses of a `GrantDynamicStatsEffect(GroupFilter.source(), …)`). Greatest power among
  creatures you control is `DynamicAmounts.battlefield(Player.You, GameObjectFilter.Creature).maxPower()`
  (Tumbleweed Rising's X/X token, paired with `Effects.CreateDynamicToken`).

### Player & game

- `LifeTotal(player)` — current life total.
- `HandSize(player)` — cards in hand.
- `TurnCount(player)` — turn number for that player.
- `TurnTracking(player, TurnTracker)` — value of a per-turn counter (see below).
- `SpellsCastThisTurn(player, filter?, excludeSelf?, fromZone?)` — count of spells `player` has cast
  this turn, read from the per-player cast history (`GameState.spellsCastThisTurnByPlayer`). `filter`
  matches a spell characteristic captured at cast time — type/color/mana value (face-down casts
  never match a non-empty filter); defaults to `GameObjectFilter.Any`. `excludeSelf` (default
  `false`) drops the resolving spell's *own* record, matched by its stack entity id, for "the
  number of **other** spells you've cast this turn". `fromZone` (default any) restricts to spells cast
  from that zone (`CastSpellRecord.castFromZone`), matched independently of `filter`. The triggering
  spell is already recorded and counts unless `excludeSelf`. DSL:
  `DynamicAmounts.spellsCastThisTurn(player, filter, excludeSelf, fromZone)`.
  - Thunder Salvo ("2 plus the number of other spells you've cast this turn"):
    `Add(Fixed(2), SpellsCastThisTurn(Player.You, excludeSelf = true))`.
  - Magebane Lizard ("the number of noncreature spells they've cast this turn"):
    `SpellsCastThisTurn(Player.TriggeringPlayer, GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)`.
  - Pairs with the `YouCastSpellsThisTurn` **condition** (§ conditions) — that gates a yes/no
    threshold, this yields the count.
- `CraftedMaterialsTotalPower` — total printed power of the cards exiled to craft the source
  permanent (CR 702.167c). Reads the source's `CraftedFromExiledComponent`. Used for the
  `*`-power CDA on Mastercraft Raptor (Saheeli's Lattice back face). Evaluates to 0 when the
  source has no recorded materials.
- `CreaturesThatCrewedOrSaddledThisTurn` (facade `DynamicAmounts.creaturesThatCrewedOrSaddledThisTurn()`)
  — number of distinct creatures that crewed (CR 702.122) or saddled (CR 702.171) the source
  permanent this turn. Source-relative: reads the source's `CrewSaddleContributorsComponent` and
  returns its size. Retains contributors that have since left the battlefield, so the count
  includes creatures no longer present as the ability resolves (Luxurious Locomotive ruling) — a
  plain `Count` over `crewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn()` can't express that. Evaluates to 0 with no
  source / no component. For *which* creatures (targeting/gathering) use the
  `CrewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn` state predicate instead.
- `PermanentsSacrificedThisWay` (facade `DynamicAmounts.permanentsSacrificedThisWay()`) — number of
  permanents sacrificed by the current resolving effect ("this way"); reads the effect context's
  `sacrificedPermanents` snapshot list (populated when an edict resolves earlier in the same
  composite — the sibling-rider wiring from the sacrifice-snapshot work). Used by "each opponent
  sacrifices a creature … create a Food token for each creature sacrificed this way" (Voracious Fell
  Beast). Evaluates to 0 when nothing was sacrificed.

### Counters

- `CountersOnSource(type)` — counters of `type` on the source permanent.
- `LastKnownCountersOnSource(type)` — counters when source last existed (for dies-triggers).
- `CountersOnTarget(target, type)` — counters on a target permanent.
- `CountersOnContext(path, type)` — counters stored in an `EffectContext` path.

### Last-known source counters (self-exile / self-sacrifice cost)

- `LastKnownSourceCounters(CounterTypeFilter)` — the number of matching counters the *source* had the moment its
  self-exile / self-sacrifice cost wiped them (CR 112.7a / 122.2). When an activated ability's cost exiles or
  sacrifices its own source, the counters are gone by resolution, so `ActivateAbilityHandler` snapshots them into the
  resolution context at cost-payment time and this node reads them back. `CounterTypeFilter.Any` sums all counter
  types; otherwise it reads the named/typed counter. Facade: `DynamicAmounts.lastKnownSourceCounters(filter)`.
  Example — Lost Isle Calling: "{4}{U}{U}, Exile this enchantment: Draw a card for each verse counter on this
  enchantment. If it had seven or more verse counters on it, take an extra turn." Both the draw amount
  (`DrawCards(lastKnownSourceCounters(Named(Counters.VERSE)))`) and the seven-or-more gate
  (`Compare(lastKnownSourceCounters(Named(Counters.VERSE)), GTE, Fixed(7))`) read this node. Contrast
  `EntityProperty(Source, CounterCount(filter))`, which reads counters on the still-present source (zero after a
  self-exile cost).

### Station

- `StationCharge` — the number of charge counters a Station ability puts on its permanent: the power of the creature
  tapped to pay the station cost (CR 702.184a). Emitted by the `station()` builder (§11); do not hand-author. It is a
  dedicated node rather than `EntityProperty(TappedAsCost(0), Power)` so the CR 702.184c characteristic substitution
  (Tapestry Warden's `StationUsingToughness` → use toughness when toughness > power) is confined to station abilities
  and never rewrites an unrelated "tap a creature: do X equal to its power" read. Resolves with last-known information
  (CR 112.7a) if the tapped creature has left the battlefield before the station ability resolves.

### Card properties

- `TargetPower(target)` — target's current power.
- `TargetToughness(target)` — target's current toughness.
- `TargetManaValue(target)` — target's mana value.
- `DynamicAmounts.targetManaSpent(index)` — sum of all `manaSpent{Color}` buckets on
  the targeted spell's `SpellOnStackComponent` (i.e. what was actually paid, after
  cost reductions/increases). Pair with `targetManaValue()` for "if the amount of
  mana spent to cast that spell was less than its mana value" gates (Unravel).
  Desugars to `EntityProperty(EntityReference.Target(index), EntityNumericProperty.ManaSpent)`.
  Returns 0 if the target isn't a spell on the stack.
- `DynamicAmounts.targetColorCount(index)` / `DynamicAmounts.colorCountOf(entity)` — number of
  distinct colors of the indexed cast-time target / any `EntityReference`. Desugars to
  `EntityProperty(entity, EntityNumericProperty.ColorCount)`. Read from projected state for
  battlefield permanents (honors layer-5 color-changing — a creature turned colorless counts 0).
  Powers "for each color of [it]" amounts, e.g. Dragonfire Blade's equip cost reduction.
- `EntityProperty(entity, EntityNumericProperty.ExcessMarkedDamage)` — the excess damage (CR 120.4a)
  marked on a creature: `max(0, marked − toughness)`, read from post-damage state. Amount-valued twin of
  the `TargetMarkedDamageExceedsToughness` condition. Read it AFTER a deal-damage step in the same
  composite/pipeline resolution so the marked damage in scope is the damage that step just dealt — e.g.
  Hell to Pay: "deals X damage to target creature. Create a number of tapped Treasure tokens equal to the
  amount of excess damage dealt to that creature this way." (`EntityProperty(EntityReference.Target(0),
  ExcessMarkedDamage)`). CompositeEffect resolves sub-effects sequentially with no interleaved SBA pass, so
  the creature is still present mid-composite with its just-marked damage. Returns 0 off the battlefield or
  for a non-creature.
- `CardNumericProperty(card, property)` — generic numeric property accessor.

### Triggering-entity shortcuts (`DynamicAmounts.*` facades)

For triggered abilities whose effect reads a property of the entity that caused the trigger
(rather than the source of the ability):

- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringPower()` — power of the triggering entity (e.g. Warstorm Surge:
  "it deals damage equal to its power").
- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringToughness()` — toughness of the triggering entity.
- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()` — mana value of the triggering entity.

All three desugar to `EntityProperty(EntityReference.Triggering, …)`.

### Attached-creature shortcut (`DynamicAmounts.*` facade)

For Aura/Equipment abilities that read a property of the creature the source is attached to (rather
than the source permanent itself — for an Aura, `EntityReference.Source` is the Aura, not the creature):

- `DynamicAmounts.enchantedCreaturePower()` — power of the attached creature (e.g. Pain for All:
  "enchanted creature deals damage equal to its power"). Desugars to
  `EntityProperty(EntityReference.EnchantedCreature, EntityNumericProperty.Power)`. The
  `EnchantedCreature` reference resolves through the source's `AttachedToComponent` (state-aware), so it
  needs an effect context with a `sourceId`; it returns 0 in predicate/filter-only contexts that don't
  thread state. When read in a **triggered ability** and the attached creature has already left the
  battlefield by resolution (e.g. removed in response to the aura's ETB trigger), it falls back to the
  creature's last-known power — captured when the trigger fired — per CR 608.2g, rather than 0.

### Ring-bearer's power (`EntityReference.RingBearer`)

- `EntityProperty(EntityReference.RingBearer(player = Player.You), EntityNumericProperty.Power)` —
  the power of the referenced player's designated **Ring-bearer** (CR 701.54: the creature carrying
  `RingBearerComponent` and controlled by its designating owner), or 0 when that player has no
  Ring-bearer. The reference always reads the *referenced* player's bearer independent of any later
  player-context rebinding — so inside a `ForEachPlayerEffect` / mill-each-player, "each player mills
  cards equal to **your** Ring-bearer's power" (One Ring to Rule Them All) measures the spell
  controller's Ring-bearer for every player. `player` defaults to `Player.You` ("your Ring-bearer");
  opponent variants resolve through the effect context's `opponentId`.

### Attachment-count shortcuts (`DynamicAmounts.*` facades)

For "X = the number of [things] attached to this permanent":

- `DynamicAmounts.attachmentsOnSelf()` — every Aura/Equipment/Fortification attached to the source
  (Champion of the Flame, Valduk). Desugars to `EntityProperty(Source, AttachmentCount())`
  (`AttachmentKind.ANY`).
- `DynamicAmounts.equipmentAttachedToSelf()` — only the Equipment attached to the source (Shagrat,
  Loot Bearer: "amass Orcs X, where X is the number of Equipment attached to Shagrat"). Desugars to
  `EntityProperty(Source, AttachmentCount(AttachmentKind.EQUIPMENT))`.

`AttachmentCount(kind)` takes an `AttachmentKind` (`ANY` / `EQUIPMENT` / `AURA`); the evaluator
counts the source's `attachedIds` whose card type matches the kind.

### Just-amassed Army (`EntityReference.AmassedArmy`)

For composite "Amass [subtype] N. Then [effect using the amassed Army's …]" shapes — Foray of
Orcs, Surrounded by Orcs, Grishnákh Brash Instigator. Compose `Effects.Amass(...)` with a
sibling effect that reads `DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(EntityReference.AmassedArmy, …)`:

- `EntityReference.AmassedArmy` — the Army that received the +1/+1 counters from the most
  recent Amass step in the current resolution pipeline (CR 701.47). Written by `AmassExecutor`
  into `EffectContext.pipeline.storedCollections[AmassedArmy.STORAGE_KEY]` after Amass
  resolves; the slot survives the multi-Army choice continuation, so a follow-up sibling
  reads the chosen Army even when Amass paused for a decision.
- Pair with `EntityNumericProperty.{Power,Toughness}` for "deals damage equal to the amassed
  Army's power" (Foray of Orcs) or "mills X cards, where X is the amassed Army's power"
  (Surrounded by Orcs).
- It also resolves inside **target / affected-entity filters** via the pipeline-threaded
  predicate path (below), so comparison-based targeting like Grishnákh's "with power ≤ the
  amassed Army's power" works — `TargetFilter.…powerAtMostEntity(EntityReference.AmassedArmy)`.

#### Pipeline values inside target filters (`powerAtMostEntity`/`powerLessThanEntity` + `AmassedArmy`)

A target filter can compare each candidate against a **resolution-time pipeline value** — the
Army just amassed by a sibling/action effect, or any cost-chosen entity. The plumbing:

- `PredicateContext` carries `storedCollections` (the pipeline's `storedCollections`, threaded
  by `PredicateContext.fromEffectContext`). `PredicateEvaluator.resolveEntityReference` resolves
  `EntityReference.AmassedArmy` / `FromCostStorage` from it (mirroring
  `TargetResolutionUtils.resolveEntityReference`), instead of returning null.
- `TargetFinder.findLegalTargets(..., pipelineContext = …)` accepts the resolving effect's
  `PredicateContext` and folds it into the per-candidate context, so **target enumeration** sees
  the pipeline. `ReflexiveTriggerEffectExecutor` passes it for deferred ("when you do, … target …")
  triggers, which is how Grishnákh filters its steal target.
- Pair with `.powerAtMostEntity(ref)` / `.powerLessThanEntity(ref)` / `.powerGreaterThanEntity(ref)`
  on the `TargetFilter`. With `ref = EntityReference.AmassedArmy`, after "amass Orcs 2" the legal
  targets exclude any creature with power > 2. This same plumbing unblocks Ent-Draught Basin's
  "target creature with power X"-style references that need a pipeline-known bound.

### Context-plumbed

- `ContextProperty(key)` — value plumbed via `EffectContext`. Keys include:
  - `TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` — damage in the current trigger payload (Tephraderm).
  - `TRIGGER_LIFE_GAINED` / `TRIGGER_LIFE_LOST` — life delta from a `LifeChangedEvent`.
  - `TRIGGER_COUNTERS_PLACED_AMOUNT` — counters placed in the triggering event (Simic Ascendancy).
  - `LAST_KNOWN_PLUS_ONE_COUNTER_COUNT` / `LAST_KNOWN_TOTAL_COUNTER_COUNT` — counters on the
    source as it last existed on the battlefield (Hooded Hydra / Shadow Urchin).
  - `ADDITIONAL_COST_EXILED_COUNT` — cost-step accumulator. (The blight-X amount moved to
    `DynamicAmount.CastChoice(ChoiceSlot.BLIGHT_AMOUNT)`.)
  - `TARGET_COUNT` — still-legal targets in the current effect context.
  - `LINKED_EXILE_CARD_COUNT` / `LINKED_EXILE_DISTINCT_CARD_TYPE_COUNT` — cards / distinct
    types in the source's linked exile pile (Veteran Survivor / Keen-Eyed Curator).
  - `MODES_CHOSEN_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` — number of mode picks recorded on the cast that fired
    the trigger (Riku of Many Paths). Counts selections, not distinct modes, so Spree with
    the same mode twice reads as `2`.
  - `MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` — total mana spent to cast the spell that fired the
    trigger (Aberrant Manawurm's "+X/+0 ... where X is the amount of mana spent to cast that
    spell", Expressive Firedancer's "if five or more mana was spent"). Distinct from
    `DynamicAmount.TotalManaSpent`, which reads the *current resolving object's own* cast — this
    reads the **triggering** spell's cast (the payoff lives on a separate permanent). Populated
    from `SpellCastEvent.totalManaSpent`; `0` for non-cast triggers.
  - `COLORS_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` — number of distinct *colors* of mana spent to cast the
    spell that fired the trigger (0–5; colorless is not a color, CR 105.1). The triggering-spell
    analogue of `DistinctColorsManaSpent` (which reads the resolving object's own cast, i.e.
    Converge): this reads the **triggering** spell's payment for a payoff on a separate permanent
    (Magmablood Archaic's "creatures you control get +1/+0 ... for each color of mana spent to cast
    that spell"). Populated from `SpellCastEvent.distinctColorsSpent`; `0` for non-cast triggers.
    Facade: `DynamicAmounts.colorsSpentOnTriggeringSpell()`.
  - `TRIGGERING_SPELL_MANA_VALUE` — mana value (CR 202.3) of the spell that fired the trigger
    (Kellan, the Kid — "a permanent spell with equal or lesser mana value"). Distinct from
    `MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` (mana actually paid): this is the spell's printed mana
    value, unaffected by cost reductions / alternative costs / X. Populated from
    `SpellCastEvent.manaValue`; `0` for non-cast triggers. Pair with
    `CollectionFilter.ManaValueAtMost(ContextProperty(TRIGGERING_SPELL_MANA_VALUE))` to bound a
    gathered collection by the triggering spell's mana value.
  - `X_VALUE_OF_TRIGGERING_SPELL` — value chosen for `{X}` on the spell that fired the trigger
    (CR 601.2b) — Geometer's Arthropod's "look at the top X cards of your library." Distinct from
    `MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` (total mana paid) and `TRIGGERING_SPELL_MANA_VALUE` (printed
    mana value, where {X} counts as 0). Populated from `SpellCastEvent.xValue`; `0` for non-cast /
    no-{X} triggers. Pair with `SpellCastPredicate.HasXInCost`. Facade:
    `DynamicAmounts.xValueOfTriggeringSpell()`.
  - `TRIGGER_SCRY_COUNT` — cards looked at by the scry that fired the trigger (Celeborn the
    Wise, Elrond Master of Healing). Equals the scry N parameter.
  - `TRIGGER_EXCESS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` — damage past lethal in the trigger payload (CR 120.4a).
    Set from `DamageDealtEvent.excessAmount`; non-zero only for `DealsDamageEvent(requireExcess = true)`
    triggers — Fall of Cair Andros' "amass Orcs X, where X is the excess damage."
  - `TRIGGER_RECIPIENT_TOUGHNESS` — the damage recipient creature's toughness at the instant the
    triggering damage was dealt (CR 603.10 last-known information — survives a lethal hit). Set from
    `DamageDealtEvent.targetToughnessAtDamage`; `0` for non-creature recipients. Compare against
    `TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` for "deals damage to a creature equal to that creature's toughness"
    (Taii Wakeen, Perfect Shot).
- `AdditionalCostBlightAmount` — X paid via the Blight additional cost.
- `ChosenNumber` — number a player chose via a Choose action.
- `VariableReference(name)` — named count variable stored earlier in the same resolution (e.g. a pipeline `storeCountAs`).
- `ColorsAmongPermanents(player)` — count of distinct colors among player's permanents.
- `DistinctEntitiesInCollections(collections)` — number of *distinct* entities across the named
  pipeline collections (union, de-duplicated by entity id). Facade: `DynamicAmounts.distinctEntitiesIn(vararg)`.
  For "you affected N *different* objects" payoffs spread over several resolution-time selections —
  e.g. Call the Spirit Dragons puts a +1/+1 counter on a chosen Dragon of each color (one `SelectTarget`
  per color, each stored under its own key) and wins if five *different* Dragons received counters, so a
  multicolored Dragon chosen for two colors counts once.
- `StoredCardManaValue(collectionName)` — mana value of the **first** card in a named pipeline
  collection (Erratic Explosion-style "that card's mana value").
- `ManaValueSumOfCollection(collectionName)` — **total** mana value of *every* card in a named
  pipeline collection. Facade: `DynamicAmounts.manaValueSumOf(collectionName)`. Cards are read by
  entity id, so the value stays correct after the collection has moved zones (e.g. milled into the
  graveyard). For "you mill X cards … that player loses life equal to the total mana value of those
  cards" — Palantír of Orthanc mills into the default `"milled"` collection
  (`Patterns.Library.mill(X)`), then `Effects.LoseLife(DynamicAmounts.manaValueSumOf("milled"), opponent)`.

### `ManaColorSet`<a id="manacolorset"></a>

Color analogue of `DynamicAmount` — pure data resolved at the moment a mana effect fires.
Used by `AddManaOfChoice(colorSet, amount)`; the engine's `ManaColorSetResolver` materializes
a `Set<Color>` from the source/controller/projected state, the player picks one (or the
solver picks if there's only one), and that color is added to the pool.

- `ManaColorSet.AnyColor` — all five colors. The "any-color" default.
- `ManaColorSet.Specific(colors)` — hand-authored fixed set (e.g., `{R, G}` for a Gruul producer).
- `ManaColorSet.CommanderIdentity` — union of color identities of every commander the controller has registered. Empty (no mana produced) in non-Commander formats.
- `ManaColorSet.AmongPermanents(filter)` — colors of permanents matching `filter`, read via projected state so type/color-changing effects are honored. Mox Amber shape.
- `ManaColorSet.LandsCouldProduce(scope)` — colors any land in `scope` could produce; tapped state and activation costs are ignored (CR 106.7). `scope` is `LandControllerScope.{YOU, OPPONENTS, ANY}`. Fellwar Stone / Exotic Orchard / Reflecting Pool shape.
- `ManaColorSet.SourceChosenColor` — the single color stored on the source's `ChosenColorComponent` (set via `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.COLOR)`). Uncharted Haven / Ashling Rekindled shape.

### `ManaRestriction`

Spending restrictions attached to a unit of mana when it is added to the pool. Used by
`AddMana`, `AddColorlessMana`, and `AddManaOfChoice` (via the `restriction` parameter).
When the engine pays a spell's cost, restricted mana is consumed preferentially when its
restriction matches the spell context.

- `ManaRestriction.AnySpend` — no restriction; satisfies any spend. Used internally when
  `AddManaOfChoice(riders = ...)` is provided without an explicit restriction, so the rider
  set survives in the pool without limiting where the mana can be spent (Path of Ancestry).
- `ManaRestriction.InstantOrSorceryOnly` — only instants and sorceries.
- `ManaRestriction.KickedSpellsOnly` — only kicked spells.
- `ManaRestriction.CreatureSpellsOnly` / `CreatureMV4OrXCost` / `SpellsMV4OrGreater` —
  creature- or mana-value-gated.
- `ManaRestriction.LegendarySpellsOnly` — only legendary spells (matches `SpellPaymentContext.isLegendary`,
  populated from the cast card's `typeLine.isLegendary`). Great Hall of the Citadel
  (`AddManaInAnyCombination(2, restriction = LegendarySpellsOnly)`); Delighted Halfling pairs it with
  the `ManaSpellRider.MakesSpellUncounterable` rider on a one-mana any-color ability.
- `ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly(subtype, creatureOnly?)` — Cavern of Souls /
  Unclaimed Territory: only spells of a baked subtype, optionally creature-only.
- `ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOnly(subtypes)` — multi-subtype spend restriction: only spells
  whose type line carries **any** of the given subtypes (OR-joined). Spell-only (no ability
  variant). Maelstrom of the Spirit Dragon: `SubtypeSpellsOnly(setOf("Dragon", "Omen"))`
  ("a Dragon spell or an Omen spell").
- `ManaRestriction.CastFromExileOnly` — only spells cast from exile.
- `ManaRestriction.CastFromNonHandOnly` — only spells cast from anywhere other than
  hand (exile, graveyard, top of library, command zone, …). Mm'menon, the Right Hand's
  granted artifact mana ability. Generalizes `CastFromExileOnly` by allowing all non-hand
  origins instead of exile alone; rejects ability activations.
- `ManaRestriction.CardTypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly(cardType, allowSpells?, allowAbilities?)` —
  Steelswarm Operator shape.

### `ManaSpellRider`

Side-effects attached to mana that fire when the mana is spent on a spell. Orthogonal to
`ManaRestriction`: the restriction controls *where* the mana may be spent; the rider
controls *what happens to the spell* when it is spent. The cast pipeline either mutates the
spell directly (e.g. stamps a component) or queues a triggered ability onto the stack above
the spell when the rider needs the stack (typically because it requires a player decision).

- `ManaSpellRider.MakesSpellUncounterable` — Cavern of Souls: stamps `CantBeCounteredComponent`
  on the spell at cast time.
- `ManaSpellRider.ScryOnSharedTypeWithCommander(amount)` — Path of Ancestry: if the spell is
  a creature spell that shares a creature type with any of the controller's commanders,
  queues a `scry amount` triggered ability above the spell.

### `ManaExpiry`<a id="manaexpiry"></a>

The *duration* axis of mana — when it leaves the pool — orthogonal to `ManaRestriction` (where it
may be spent) and `ManaSpellRider` (what happens to the spell). Passed via the `expiry` parameter
of `AddMana`. The engine empties pools at end of turn, so:

- `ManaExpiry.END_OF_TURN` — the default; ordinary mana cleared by the end-of-turn pool emptying.
- `ManaExpiry.END_OF_COMBAT` — firebending-style mana (CR 702.189): kept through combat, discarded
  by `CombatManager.endCombat` when the combat phase ends ("Any of this mana you still have as combat
  ends will be lost"). Stored as an `AnySpend` restricted-pool entry tagged with the expiry, so it
  spends like any other mana and the tag survives partial spends.

### `TurnTracker` keys (used with `TurnTracking`)

- `CREATURES_DIED` — creatures that died this turn.
- `NONTOKEN_CREATURES_DIED` — nontoken creatures that died this turn.
- `OPPONENT_CREATURES_EXILED` — opponent creatures you exiled.
- `OPPONENTS_WHO_LOST_LIFE` — count of opponents who lost life.
- `DAMAGE_RECEIVED` — damage received by player.
- `LIFE_GAINED` — life gained this turn (Bre of Clan Stoutarm).
- `LIFE_LOST` — life lost this turn.
- `PLAYER_ATTACKED` — whether/how many times you attacked.
- `DEALT_COMBAT_DAMAGE` — combat damage dealt.
- `COUNTERS_PUT_ON_CREATURE` — counters placed.
- `LANDS_PLAYED` — lands the player explicitly played this turn (from-hand land drops only,
  derived from `LandDropsComponent`).
- `LANDS_ENTERED_UNDER_CONTROL` — lands that entered the battlefield under the player's
  control this turn. Counts *every* land ETB regardless of how it arrived (land drops,
  Lander-token search, Cultivate-style "put a land onto the battlefield" effects,
  opponent-gift effects), so it differs from `LANDS_PLAYED`. Backs
  `DynamicAmounts.landsEnteredUnderControlThisTurn(player)` — e.g. Bioengineered Future's
  "for each land that entered the battlefield under your control this turn."
- `FOOD_SACRIFICED` — Food tokens sacrificed.
- `CARDS_LEFT_GRAVEYARD` — cards leaving your graveyard.
- `DESCENDED` — number of times a player has descended this turn (CR 700.11) — i.e.
  count of nontoken permanent cards put into that player's graveyard from any zone.
  Backs `Conditions.YouDescendedThisTurn(atLeast)` and `DynamicAmounts.descendedThisTurn`
  (descend N / fathomless descent ability words).
- `CARDS_DRAWN` — number of cards a player has drawn this turn (backed by
  `CardsDrawnThisTurnComponent`, reset to 0 for every player at turn start). Powers
  characteristic-defining stats like Duelist of the Mind's "power is equal to the number of
  cards you've drawn this turn" via `dynamicPower = CharacteristicValue.dynamic(TurnTracking(You, CARDS_DRAWN))`.

`SubtypeEnteredUnderControlThisTurn(player, subtype, excludeTriggeringEntity?)` /
`DynamicAmounts.subtypeEnteredUnderControlThisTurn(subtype, player?, excludeTriggeringEntity?)` —
"the number of [other] [subtype]s that entered the battlefield under [player]'s control this turn"
(Geralf, the Fleshwright — "each other Zombie that entered the battlefield under your control this
turn"). It's a **turn-history** count: backed by `PermanentsEnteredUnderControlThisTurnComponent`,
which records each entrant's subtypes (from projected state) at entry, so a permanent that has since
left the battlefield or lost the type still counts. `excludeTriggeringEntity = true` drops the
permanent whose entry triggered the ability (giving "each *other*"); because every simultaneous
entrant is recorded before the triggers resolve, each one sees the others (2024-04-12 ruling).

## 14. Modal & choice

### Modal spells

```kotlin
spell {
    modal(chooseCount = 1) {
        mode("Destroy a creature") {
            val c = target("creature", Targets.Creature)
            effect = Effects.Destroy(c)
        }
        mode("Draw a card") {
            effect = Effects.DrawCards(1)
        }
    }
}
```

- `modal(chooseCount = N) { ... }` — N modes picked at cast time (or resolution for Commands).
- `mode(description) { ... }` — one option with its own targets/effect.
- `.requiresTarget(filter)` — mode needs a target matching filter.
- `.optional()` — mode can be skipped.
- `Mode.noTarget(...)` — explicit target-less mode (outer targets are preserved).

`ModalEffect.chooseOne { mode(...) }` and `ModalEffect.chooseN(n) { ... }` for explicit modal effects.

**Dynamic "choose up to X"** — `ModalEffect.chooseUpToDynamic(dynamicMax, *modes, allowRepeat = false)`
caps the pick count by a `DynamicAmount` evaluated at resolution time. `minChooseCount` is
forced to `0` (the player may always decline); `chooseCount` becomes `min(eval, modes.size)`.
If the evaluated cap is `0` the effect resolves as a no-op. Used by Riku of Many Paths,
where the cap is `ContextProperty(MODES_CHOSEN_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL)`. Equivalent raw shape:
`ModalEffect(modes, chooseCount = modes.size, minChooseCount = 0, dynamicChooseCount = …)`.

**Cast-time mode-selection UX (Spree / "choose one or more").** A choose-N modal *spell* cast
by a human is presented as a **single mode-selection panel** (web client), not a sequential
one-mode-at-a-time prompt. The enumerator emits one `CastSpellModal` legal action carrying a
`modalEnumeration` payload (each mode's description, `+ {cost}`, availability, and target
requirements); the client's cast pipeline opens the panel from that payload, lets the player
toggle the mode subset (respecting `minChooseCount`/`chooseCount`, and a count stepper when
`allowRepeat`), shows the live combined additional/total mana cost, and submits a `CastSpell`
with `chosenModes` populated but **targets deferred**. The engine then drives per-mode
on-battlefield target selection (`CastSpellHandler` pauses via the existing
`CastModalTargetSelectionContinuation`) before cost payment — so `validate()`/`execute()` accept
"modes chosen, targets deferred" as a legitimate intermediate cast state. Server-synthesized
free casts (Cascade, Sunbird's Invocation) and the AI still use the sequential server-side
mode-selection pause; choose-1 modal spells remain client-local `CastSpellMode` actions. No SDK
change is needed to author a Spree card — it is a plain `ModalEffect` with per-mode
`additionalManaCost` (see Trash the Town).

**Cast-time conditional choose count** — for modal *spells* the same `dynamicChooseCount`
field is evaluated against the battlefield **at cast time** (in `CastSpellHandler`,
`effectiveModalChooseCounts`), and — unlike `chooseUpToDynamic` — it keeps the `minChooseCount`
floor instead of forcing `0`. The effective upper bound is `eval.coerceIn(minChooseCount,
modes.size)`. This models "Choose one. If [condition] as you cast this spell, you may choose
two instead." (Flame of Anor): pass it via the DSL with
`modal(chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1, dynamicChooseCount = …) { … }`. Combine a
`DynamicAmount.Conditional` with a control condition, e.g.

```kotlin
modal(
    chooseCount = 2,
    minChooseCount = 1,
    dynamicChooseCount = DynamicAmount.Conditional(
        condition = Conditions.YouControlAtLeast(1, GameObjectFilter.Creature.withSubtype("Wizard")),
        ifTrue = DynamicAmount.Fixed(2),
        ifFalse = DynamicAmount.Fixed(1)
    )
) { /* modes */ }
```

**"Choose one that hasn't been chosen"** — `ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen(*modes)` for a
repeatable modal *ability* whose source remembers which modes it has already chosen across the
game and never offers them again (Gandalf the Grey). Equivalent raw shape:
`ModalEffect(modes, chooseCount = 1, excludePreviouslyChosenModes = true, countsAsModalSpell =
false)`. The engine records each chosen mode index in a per-source
`ChosenModesEverComponent` and excludes it from every later presentation of the effect; once all
modes have been chosen the ability has no legal mode and resolves as a no-op. The memory is keyed
to the source object and persists while it remains the same object on the battlefield (CR 700.4) —
it resets if the permanent leaves and returns as a new object. Intended for triggered/activated
abilities on a persistent source, not one-shot modal spells.

```kotlin
triggeredAbility {
    trigger = Triggers.YouCastInstantOrSorcery
    effect = ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen(
        Mode.withTarget(/* tap or untap */, Targets.Permanent, "You may tap or untap target permanent"),
        Mode.noTarget(Effects.DealDamage(3, EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.EachOpponent)), "…"),
        Mode.withTarget(Effects.CopyTargetSpell(), Targets.InstantOrSorcerySpellYouControl, "…"),
        Mode.noTarget(Effects.PutOnTopOfLibrary(EffectTarget.Self), "…"),
    )
}
```

### Permanent enters-with-choice (Sieges)

```kotlin
EntersWithChoice(
    ChoiceType.MODE,
    modeOptions = listOf(
        ModeOption(id = "khans", label = "Khans", description = "...", iconKey = "khans"),
        ModeOption(id = "dragons", label = "Dragons", description = "...", iconKey = "dragons"),
    ),
)
```

- Writes `ChosenModeComponent(modeId)` on the permanent.
- Downstream triggers/conditions gate via `SourceChosenModeIs("khans")`.
- Icons live in `web-client/src/assets/icons/options/`.

**Other `ChoiceType`s** — `ChoiceType.COLOR` writes `ChosenColorComponent` (read by
`GrantChosenColor`), `ChoiceType.CREATURE_TYPE` writes `ChosenCreatureTypeComponent`,
`ChoiceType.CREATURE_ON_BATTLEFIELD` writes `ChosenCreatureComponent`,
`ChoiceType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE` writes `ChosenLandTypeComponent` (read by
`SetEnchantedLandTypeFromChosen` and `GrantLandwalkOfChosenType`), and
`ChoiceType.OPPONENT` writes an entity-id choice into the `CastChoicesComponent` under
`ChoiceSlot.OPPONENT` — read back via the `Player.ChosenOpponent` reference (e.g. Jihad's
anthem + state-trigger condition: `Exists(Player.ChosenOpponent, Zone.BATTLEFIELD, …)`), and
`ChoiceType.CARD_NAME` writes a chosen **land card name** (every registered land name, presented as
a searchable option list) into the `CastChoicesComponent` under `ChoiceSlot.CARD_NAME` as a
`ChoiceValue.TextChoice` — read back via `chosenCardName()` or, for name-keyed static-ability
filters, `GameObjectFilter.namedFromChosenComponent()` (→ `CardPredicate.NameEqualsChosenComponent`,
see §7). Used by Petrified Hamlet ("When this land enters, choose a land card name", then two
statics — `PreventActivatedAbilities(nonManaAbilitiesOnly = true)` and `GrantActivatedAbility` of a
`{T}: Add {C}` mana ability — both filtered by `namedFromChosenComponent()`). Example — Phantasmal Terrain
("As this Aura enters, choose a basic land type. Enchanted land is the chosen type."):

```kotlin
auraTarget = Targets.Land
replacementEffect(EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE))
staticAbility { ability = SetEnchantedLandTypeFromChosen }
```

Traveler's Cloak grants landwalk of the chosen type to the enchanted creature instead:

```kotlin
auraTarget = Targets.Creature
replacementEffect(EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.BASIC_LAND_TYPE))
staticAbility { ability = GrantLandwalkOfChosenType() }
```

### Other choice effects

- `ChooseActionEffect(choices)` — pick one effect from a list.
- `ChooseColorThenEffect(whenChosen)` — pick a color, then apply a function of the color.
- `GrantHexproofFromChosenColorEffect(target)` / `GrantProtectionFromChosenColorEffect(target)` — atoms that run inside `ChooseColorThen` and read the chosen color from context (hexproof / protection from that color). Wrap in `ForEachInGroup` for "creatures you control gain protection from the chosen color" (Akroma's Blessing).
- `Effects.ForEachColorOf(source, effect)` — the **non-interactive sibling of `ChooseColorThen`**:
  runs `effect` once per color of the entity referenced by `source`, with that color set as the
  context's chosen color, so the same per-color atoms (`GrantProtectionFromChosenColor`,
  `GrantHexproofFromChosenColor`, `GrantCantBeBlockedByChosenColor`, …) compose inside it. Source
  colors come from projected state while the source is on the battlefield (Layer-5 / Devoid honored),
  else its base `CardComponent.colors` (LKI); a colorless source runs zero times (CR 105.2). For
  "[group] gain protection from each of `source`'s colors", wrap a group iteration in it —
  `Effects.ForEachColorOf(source, ForEachInGroupEffect(group, GrantProtectionFromChosenColor(Self)))`
  — and, when `source` is the about-to-leave permanent, place it before the exile/destroy step
  (`Composite(ForEachColorOf(…), Exile(…))`) so its colors are still readable (Éowyn, Fearless Knight).
- `ChooseCreatureTypeEffect(...)` — pause for creature-type selection.
- `Effects.NoteCreatureType(storeAs = "notedType", prompt?)` — "note a creature type that hasn't been noted for this <source>" (LTR — Long List of the Ents). Same decision shape as `ChooseOption(OptionType.CREATURE_TYPE)`, but the source's *current* `NotedCreatureTypesComponent.types` are excluded from the option list (so the player can't pick a duplicate), and on resolution the chosen type is appended to that component on the source AND stored in `chosenValues[storeAs]` for any downstream pipeline step. The component lives on the source permanent's container, so it disappears when the source leaves play (CR 400.7 — a permanent that changes zones becomes a new object with no memory of its previous existence). Use this whenever a card's text says "note … for this permanent"; use plain `ChooseOption(OptionType.CREATURE_TYPE)` when the choice is one-shot and doesn't need to accumulate.
- `Effects.ChooseCardName(storeAs, prompt?, excludeBasicLandNames?)` — name a card (`ChooseOptionEffect(OptionType.CARD_NAME)`); the chosen name is stored in `chosenValues[storeAs]`. Options are every registry card name (searchable list, not free text); `excludeBasicLandNames` drops the five basics. Match cards by it with `GameObjectFilter.namedFromVariable(storeAs)`. (Desperate Research)
- `Effects.StoreCardName(from, storeAs)` — capture the name of the first card in collection `from` into `chosenValues[storeAs]`. The "choose a card, then act on cards of that name" counterpart to `ChooseCardName`. (Lobotomy)
- `SelectTargetEffect(...)` — pick from a valid target set.

---

## 15. Replacement effects

```kotlin
replacementEffect {
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(Filters.Swamp)
    effect = ReplacementEffect.PreventDamage(1)
}
```

- `ReplacementEffect.PreventDamage(amount?, restrictions?, appliesTo)` — prevent damage matching the
  `EventPattern.DamageEvent` shape. `amount = null` prevents all; a number prevents up to that much.
  `restrictions: List<Condition>` (default empty) gates the prevention on extra conditions evaluated
  against the source's controller — the same pattern as `ModifyLifeLoss.restrictions`. Use it for
  "as long as …, prevent …" statics (Spirit of Resistance: a five-distinct-colors `Compare` gate).
- `CapDamage(maxAmount, appliesTo)` — clamp matching damage to `maxAmount` (a *replacement* distinct
  from prevent/modify; applied after all amplification). Divine Presence: `CapDamage(3, DamageEvent(recipient = Any))`.
- `RedirectDamage(redirectTo, appliesTo)` — redirect matching damage to another recipient. Now wired
  as a continuous static replacement (each source applies at most once per damage event). `redirectTo`
  supports `EffectTarget.ControllerOfDamageSource` (the controller of the damaging source),
  `Controller`/`Self` (the replacement's owner/controller), and `TargetController`. Harsh Judgment:
  redirect chosen-color instant/sorcery damage dealt to you back to the spell's controller.
- **DamageEvent filters (gap #7):** `EventPattern.DamageEvent(recipient, source, damageType, amount)`.
  `amount: AmountFilter` (`Any` / `AtMost(n)` / `AtLeast(n)` / `Exactly(n)`) gates on the would-be
  amount (Callous Giant: `AtMost(3)`). `source = SourceFilter.Matching(filter)` can carry relational
  predicates: `GameObjectFilter.sharingColorWithRecipient()` (`CardPredicate.SharesColorWithRecipient`,
  Well-Laid Plans — "another creature that shares a color") and `sharingChosenColorWithSource()`
  (`CardPredicate.SharesChosenColorWithSource`, reads the replacement source's `ChosenColorComponent`).
- `EntersTapped(unlessCondition?, payLifeCost?)` — "this permanent enters tapped" (`unlessCondition = null`),
  or "enters tapped unless `<condition>`" when an `unlessCondition` is supplied. The "slow land" cycle
  (Deathcap Glade, Dreamroot Cascade, Sundown Pass — "enters tapped unless you control two or more other
  lands") uses `unlessCondition = Conditions.YouControlAtLeast(3, GameObjectFilter.Land)`: the
  `AggregateBattlefield` count includes the entering land itself, so "two or more *other* lands" is
  "three or more lands total". The parallel "fast land" cycle (Blooming Marsh — "two or fewer other lands")
  uses an `LTE`-direction `Compare(AggregateBattlefield(You, Land), LTE, Fixed(3))`. `payLifeCost` renders
  the "you may pay N life; if you don't, it enters tapped" variant.
- `ReplacementEffect.IfYouDoBranchEffect(...)` — branch on "if you do" replacement.
- `OnEnterRunEffect(effect)` — generic "as ~ enters the battlefield, run [effect]". The wrapped effect
  executes via the normal effect-executor pipeline at entry time (so `EffectTarget.Self` resolves to
  the entering permanent) and may pause for player input. Compose with atomic pausable effects like
  `Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand` to build SOI shadow lands or other "as ~ enters" choices.
  **Scope today:** only wired into the land-play path (`PlayLandHandler`). When the first non-land
  permanent needs this, also wire it into `StackResolver.enterPermanentOnBattlefield`.
- `EntersWithCounters(counterType?, count, selfOnly?, condition?, appliesTo?)` /
  `EntersWithDynamicCounters(counterType?, count, otherOnly?, appliesTo?)` — "[permanent] enters with
  N counters." `EntersWithCounters` takes a fixed `count: Int` (Master Biomancer, Metallic Mimic);
  `EntersWithDynamicCounters` takes a `count: DynamicAmount` (Stag Beetle; the SOS Converge "Archaic"
  cycle via `convergeEntersWithCounters()` → `count = DistinctColorsManaSpent`). `appliesTo` defaults
  to "creatures you control entering the battlefield." Two scopes:
  - **Self** (default) — applies to the permanent that owns the replacement. Reserve a *dynamic* count
    for "this creature enters with a counter for each color of mana spent to cast **it**" / "for each X
    it has".
  - **`otherOnly = true`** — applies to *other* matching creatures entering (Gev, Scaled Scorch:
    "Other creatures you control enter with additional counters"; Wildgrowth Archaic: "whenever you
    cast a creature spell, that creature enters with X additional +1/+1 counters … where X is the
    number of colors of mana spent to cast **it**"). The `count` is always evaluated against the
    **entering object**, not the replacement source — so an entering-object amount like
    `DistinctColorsManaSpent` reads the new creature's own cast (and a token / reanimated creature that
    wasn't cast spent no mana → 0). Player-scoped counts (`TurnTracking(Player.You)`, Gev) still read
    the replacement source's controller.
- `EntersWithDevour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, counterType, variant)` — Devour (CR 702.82) and its
  printed variants. As the permanent resolves from the stack, the controller is prompted to pick any
  number of their own permanents matching `sacrificeFilter`. Those permanents are sacrificed and the
  entering permanent gains `multiplier × count` counters of `counterType` (default `+1/+1`). Pair
  with `KeywordAbility.Devour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, variant)` so the rules text renders. The
  `variant` parameter is a textual tag only — `""` for plain Devour, `"land"` for the EOE
  "Devour land N" wording. **Scope today:** only the stack-spell entry path is wired; reanimation and
  token entries skip Devour (which is fine for printed cards — Devour creatures all cost real mana to
  cast).
- `ModifyCounterPlacement(modifier, appliesTo)` / `DoubleCounterPlacement(placedByYou?, appliesTo)` —
  **static** counter-placement modifiers living on a battlefield permanent for as long as it remains
  (Hardened Scales `+1`, Winding Constrictor `+1`, Doubling Season doubles). `appliesTo` is an
  `EventPattern.CounterPlacementEvent(counterType, recipient)`; `recipient = CreatureYouControl` is
  resolved relative to the *source permanent's* controller. For the **activated/spell-granted,
  duration-scoped** version of this (Prairie Dog), use the effect
  `Effects.GrantCounterPlacementModifier(...)` (§4 Counters) instead — it records a controller-scoped
  modifier in a turn-scoped game-state store consulted from the same counter-placement chokepoint,
  and expires at end of turn.
- `ReplaceTokenCreationWithAttachedCopy(optional, oncePerTurn, attachmentVerb, appliesTo)` —
  "the first time you would create one or more tokens each turn, you may instead create that
  many tokens that are copies of [attached] permanent." Works for both Equipment and Auras —
  the engine reads the source's `AttachedToComponent` to find the permanent to copy.
  `optional = true` surfaces a yes/no during resolution; `oncePerTurn = true` adds
  `TokenReplacementOfferedThisTurnComponent` after the first offer (cleared at end of turn).
  `attachmentVerb` is a display-only label ("equipped", "enchanted", "fortified") — the
  attachment-type validation already happens at cast/attach time via `equipmentTarget` /
  `auraTarget`. Token copies are summoning-sick only when the copy is a creature (CR 302.6).
  Mirrormind Crown: `attachmentVerb = "equipped"`; Moonlit Meditation: `attachmentVerb = "enchanted"`.
- `CreateAdditionalToken(additionalTokenType, additionalTokenCount = 1, inheritTapped = false, appliesTo)` —
  token-creation replacement that keeps the original tokens and appends one or more predefined tokens of
  another type. `appliesTo = EventPattern.TokenCreationEvent(controller, tokenFilter)` gates the original
  creation event, and the extra tokens are added once per qualifying event, not once per token. The added
  tokens bypass the same replacement pass so a Map added for an artifact-token event does not recursively
  trigger itself. Used by Worldwalker Helm (`TokenCreationEvent(You, Artifact)`, add `Map`, `inheritTapped = true`)
  and Peregrin Took (`additionalTokenType = "Food"`, "those tokens plus an additional Food token are created instead").
- `EntersAsCopy(optional, copyFilter, copyFromZone, filterByTotalManaSpent, additionalSubtypes, additionalKeywords, nameOverride, powerOverride, toughnessOverride, exileCopiedCard)` —
  "enter as a copy of …". As the permanent resolves, the controller picks an object matching
  `copyFilter` and the permanent enters as a copy (Rule 707 copiable values), with any overrides
  applied. `copyFromZone` selects the candidate pool: `Zone.BATTLEFIELD` (default — Clone, Clever
  Impersonator, Mockingbird) copies a permanent in play; `Zone.GRAVEYARD` copies a creature *card*
  from any graveyard (Superior Spider-Man) via the modal card-list overlay. `additionalSubtypes` /
  `additionalKeywords` are added "in addition to its other types"; `nameOverride` keeps a fixed name;
  `powerOverride` / `toughnessOverride` force base P/T; `exileCopiedCard` exiles the copied card after
  the copy ("When you do, exile that card"). `filterByTotalManaSpent` restricts copy targets to mana
  value ≤ total mana spent (Mockingbird). The copy snapshots a `CopyOfComponent` so it reverts to its
  printed identity when it leaves the battlefield (CR 400.7 / 707.2).
- `ModifyDrawAmount(modifier, restrictions, appliesTo)` — modify the number of cards a draw
  instruction announces by a fixed amount, optionally gated by extra `restrictions: List<Condition>`
  evaluated against the drawing player as controller. Applied **once** per draw instruction at the
  announcement site — `DrawCardsExecutor.execute` for spell/ability draws and
  `DrawPhaseManager.performDrawStep` for the draw step (CR 121.2a: "An instruction to draw multiple
  cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number of cards drawn. This
  modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws.") — so a paused-and-
  resumed per-card loop doesn't double-modify. Note that "you" in restriction text reads as the
  drawing player, not the source's controller; for `DrawEvent(player = Player.You)` they coincide,
  but `DrawEvent(player = Player.EachOpponent)` cards needing "you" = source controller would have to
  use a source-relative condition instead. Use for "if you would draw one or more cards, you draw
  that many cards plus N instead" (Quantum Riddler:
  `ModifyDrawAmount(modifier = 1, restrictions = listOf(Conditions.CardsInHandAtMost(1)), appliesTo = DrawEvent(player = Player.You))`).
- `ModifyLifeGain(multiplier, modifier, appliesTo, restrictions)` — modify life gain by a multiplicative *and/or*
  additive factor: `gained = (original * multiplier) + modifier`, clamped to ≥ 0. `appliesTo` is a `LifeGainEvent`
  whose `player` filter (default `Player.Each`) gates which players the replacement applies to. `restrictions`
  (a `List<Condition>`, ALL must hold, evaluated against the gaining player as controller) gates *when* it applies
  — e.g. Phial of Galadriel `restrictions = listOf(Conditions.LifeAtMost(5))` ("while you have 5 or less life").
  Used by Alhammarret's Archive (`multiplier = 2`), Leyline of Hope (`multiplier = 1, modifier = 1, player =
  Player.You`). Multiple instances stack (×s multiply, +s sum) — two Leylines of Hope add 2 to every life-gain event.
- `ModifyLifeLoss(multiplier, modifier, restrictions, appliesTo)` — same shape as `ModifyLifeGain` for life loss
  events (`LifeLossEvent`), plus a `restrictions: List<Condition>` list that further gates the replacement.
- `LifeLossFloor(floor, restrictions, appliesTo)` — cap damage-induced life loss so the resulting life total
  is ≥ `floor`. `appliesTo` is a `LifeLossEvent` whose `player` filter gates who is protected (default
  `Player.Each`); `restrictions: List<Condition>` (evaluated against the source's controller) further
  gates the floor — same shape as `ModifyLifeLoss.restrictions`. **Scope:** damage-as-life-loss only
  (CR 120.3a); `LoseLifeExecutor` deliberately skips this step so pay-life costs and direct life-loss
  effects bypass the floor (matching the Ali from Cairo ruling "does not apply to effects which reduce
  your life without doing damage"). The damage event still fires at the original amount, so lifelink
  and damage-dealt triggers see the full damage. Multiple instances pick the strictest floor. Used by
  Ali from Cairo (`LifeLossFloor(floor = 1, appliesTo = LifeLossEvent(Player.You))`); Worship adds a
  `restrictions = listOf(YouControlACreature)` gate.
- `PreventLifeGain(appliesTo)` — life gain matching the event is fully prevented (Sulfuric Vortex, Erebos).
- Custom — implement the `ReplacementEffect` interface directly.

Amount-modifying replacements expose **both** `multiplier` (×) and `modifier` (±) on the same type — do not split into
`DoubleX` + `ModifyXAmount`.

## 16. Counters

String-keyed counter types — resolve via the central `resolveCounterType` helper rather than per-executor character
substitution.

- `+1/+1`, `-1/-1` — power/toughness counters.
- `loyalty` — planeswalker loyalty.
- `charge`, `time`, `level`, `quest`, `shield`, `fade`, `vanishing`, `experience`, `age`, `velocity`, `awakening`,
  `blood`, `cage`, `doom`, `storage`, `divinity`, `charm`, `music`, `crumble`, `corpse`, `germ`, `ink`, `growth`,
  `hour`, `energy`, `scry`, `aura`, `chapter`, `citation`, `rune`, `scar`, `crux`, `omen`, `secret`, `feather`,
  `hourglass`, `hope`, `verse`, `influence`, `burden`, `loot` — assorted printed counter kinds. (`hourglass`: Temporal Distortion
  — a permanent with one doesn't untap during its controller's untap step; model the restriction with
  `GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP.name, GroupFilter(... .withCounter(Counters.HOURGLASS)))` so it stays
  projection-scoped.) (`hope` / `verse` / `influence` / `burden`: LTR — Dawn of a New Age / Lost Isle Calling /
  Palantír of Orthanc / The One Ring. `loot`: OTJ — Bandit's Haul. `nest` (`Counters.NEST`): DSK — Twitching Doll,
  whose mana ability accumulates one per activation and whose sacrifice ability reads the count to scale a token
  payoff. `page` (`Counters.PAGE`): SOS — Diary of Dreams, whose cast-an-instant-or-sorcery trigger accumulates one
  and whose `{5},{T}: draw` ability reads the count via `genericCostReduction` to cost `{1}` less per counter.
  Pure passive counters with no inherent rule; the cards that use them accumulate/spend them via their own
  abilities and read the count via `DynamicAmounts.countersOnSelf(CounterTypeFilter.Named(Counters.X))` — or, when a
  self-sacrifice/exile cost wipes them first, `DynamicAmounts.lastKnownSourceCounters(...)` (CR 112.7a; see §13).)
- `stun` — CR 122.1d, a built-in replacement: "If a permanent with a stun counter on it would become untapped,
  instead remove a stun counter from it." Engine-wired through `untapOrConsumeStun` (`rules-engine/core/UntapHelpers.kt`),
  which is invoked from the untap step (`BeginningPhaseManager`), from `TapUntapExecutor`'s untap branch, and from the
  sacrifice/pay continuation resumer. Adding stun counters is done by `AddCounters(Counters.STUN, n, target)`.
- **Keyword counters** (Rule 122.1b) — `flying`, `first strike`, `vigilance`, `lifelink`, `indestructible`,
  `deathtouch`, `trample`, `hexproof`, `reach`. `StateProjector` grants the matching `Keyword` to any permanent
  carrying one (mapped in `KEYWORD_COUNTER_MAP`, re-applied after Layer 6 so "loses all abilities" can't wipe a
  counter-granted keyword). Add via `AddCounters(Counters.DEATHTOUCH, ...)` etc.; no static ability needed.
  (`reach`: Sagu Pummeler's renew payoff puts a reach counter on a creature. `vigilance`: Aragorn, Company Leader.)
- **Ability counters beyond single keywords** — `decayed` (`Counters.DECAYED`, CR 702.147a, Tarkir: Dragonstorm) grants
  the whole **Decayed** ability (a "can't block" static **and** an attack-triggered end-of-combat sacrifice) to any
  creature that bears one. `StateProjector` projects the `DECAYED` keyword + `cantBlock = true` (initial pass and the
  post-Layer-6 re-apply), and `TriggerDetector.detectDecayedCounterAttackTriggers` schedules the self-sacrifice when a
  decayed-countered creature attacks. Add via `AddCounters(Counters.DECAYED, n, target)` (Rot-Curse Rakshasa's Renew).

Counter effects live in §4 (`AddCounters`, `RemoveCounters`, `Proliferate`, `MoveAllLastKnownCounters`, etc.).

## 17. Zones & movement

**Zones** — `BATTLEFIELD`, `HAND`, `LIBRARY`, `GRAVEYARD`, `EXILE`, `STACK`.

**Primitives**

- `MoveToZoneEffect(target, zone, faceDown?, byDestruction?, linked?)` — single-target move. Card
  definitions construct it via the facade `Effects.Move(target, destination, …)` (or the named
  shortcuts `Effects.Destroy/Exile/ReturnToHand/PutOnTopOfLibrary/ShuffleIntoLibrary/…`).
- `MoveCollectionEffect(collectionName, zone, faceDown?, linkToSource?, asOwner?, likelyPosition?)` — pipeline move of a
  stored collection.
- `faceDown` (on both move effects) is a nullable **`FaceDownMode`** — `null` = enter face up;
  `MORPH` = face-down with the card's morph cost as its turn-up cost; `MANIFEST` = face-down with
  the card's mana cost as its turn-up cost (only if it's a creature card, CR 701.40b); `HIDDEN` =
  face down with no turn-up (e.g. exiled face down for Hideaway). The engine derives the turn-up
  data at entry, so a manifested creature reuses the whole morph turn-up machinery (special action,
  payment, flip).
- `GatherCardsEffect(source, filter, into)` — pipeline gather from a zone into a named collection. `CardSource`
  variants include zones (`FromZone`, `FromMultipleZones`), battlefield queries (`BattlefieldMatching`,
  `ControlledPermanents`), linked exile (`FromLinkedExile`), tapped-as-cost (`TappedAsCost`), and the resolved
  spell/ability targets (`ChosenTargets`). The zone/library sources (`FromZone`, `FromMultipleZones`,
  `TopOfLibrary`) accept a multi-player `player` reference (`Player.Each`, `Player.ActivePlayerFirst`,
  `Player.EachOpponent`) and fan out across every relevant player's copy of the zone in a single gather —
  e.g. "all creature cards in each player's graveyard" (Bringer of the Last Gift). Pair with
  `MoveCollectionEffect(underOwnersControl = true)` to return each card to its owner.
- `CaptureControllersEffect(from, storeAs)` — snapshot each entity's current controller into a parallel
  `List<EntityId>` under `storedCollections[storeAs]`. Required when a later step needs "who controlled
  this card before it left the battlefield" — `ControllerComponent` is stripped on move-out.
- `ForEachCapturedControllerEffect(collection, originalCollection, controllerSnapshot, countVariable?, effects)` —
  cross-references a post-move `collection` against an `originalCollection` + parallel `controllerSnapshot` to
  build per-controller tallies, then runs `effects` once per controller (turn order from the active player). Each
  iteration sets `context.controllerId` to the controller (so `Player.You` / `EffectTarget.Controller` resolve to
  them) and writes the tally into `storedNumbers[countVariable]` (default `"iterationCount"`) for
  `DynamicAmount.VariableReference` to read. Outer `storedCollections` are preserved (unlike
  `ForEachPlayerEffect`). Used by Builder's Bane via the
  `GatherCards(ChosenTargets) → CaptureControllers → MoveCollection(Destroy, storeMovedAs) → ForEachCapturedController`
  shape.
- `ForEachInCollectionEffect(collection, effect)` — run `effect` once per entity in a named pipeline collection
  (snapshotted at resolution), with `pipeline.iterationTarget` set to that entity. Lowers to
  `ForEachEffect(IterationSpace.Collection(...))` — see the unified ForEach entry under "Sequencing &
  conditional". Collection-based sibling of
  `ForEachInGroupEffect` (which iterates a battlefield filter): use it to apply a per-entity effect to a *chosen*
  set rather than a re-evaluated filter. Pair with a single-target effect on `EffectTarget.Self` — e.g.
  `ForEachInCollection(nonChosenPile, Effects.CantAttack(EffectTarget.Self))` gives each creature in a chosen pile
  its own snapshot can't-attack floating effect (Fight or Flight / Stand or Fall; creatures entering after the
  split are unaffected).
- `SelectFromCollectionEffect(from, into, selectCount?, allowZero?, alwaysPrompt?, restrictions?)` — let a player pick
  from a collection. `restrictions` (`List<SelectionRestriction>`) cap and trim the picks server-side: `OnePerCardType`,
  `OnePerColor(matchControllerPermanentColors?)`, `OnePerCardName`, `TotalManaValueAtMost(max)`,
  `OnePerBasicLandType`, `ReducedMinimumIfMatches(reducedMinimum, filter, requiredMatches?)`, and
  `MaxAffordablePayment(manaPerSelected, payer?)`. `OnePerBasicLandType` keeps at most one
  land of each basic land type (a kept land claims
  *every* basic type it has) and — unlike `OnePerColor`, where a colourless card is unconstrained — a land with no
  basic land type can't be kept at all (Global Ruin: "chooses a land of each basic land type, then sacrifices the
  rest"). Each restriction also exposes a boolean flag on `SelectCardsDecision` (`onePerBasicLandType`, …) so the UI
  can disable redundant picks. `ReducedMinimumIfMatches` exposes `conditionalMinimums` on `SelectCardsDecision` so the
  UI and server can accept one matching card for "discard two unless you discard a creature card" while rejecting one
  nonmatching card. `MaxAffordablePayment` caps the selection at
  `floor(payer's available mana / manaPerSelected)` (floating + untapped sources) — pair it with a downstream
  `Gate.MayPay` over `PayDynamicMana` at the same rate so a player can never select a set whose total cost is
  unpayable and silently forfeit the payoff; a cap of zero (under `ChooseAnyNumber`) skips the selection prompt
  entirely (Magnetic Mountain: "choose any number … and pay {4} for each creature chosen this way").
  - `chooser` (`Chooser`, default `Controller`) — who makes the selection: `Controller`, `Opponent`, `TargetPlayer`
    (`context.targets[0]` treated as the player), `TriggeringPlayer`, `SourceController` (the source's controller,
    ignoring per-iteration swaps), `ControllerOfSelection` (the controller of the cards in `from` — resolved from the
    first card's projected controller), or `ControllerOfTarget` (the controller of the targeted *permanent*,
    `context.targets[0]`, falling back to its owner once it has left the battlefield). Use `ControllerOfSelection` for
    "their controller chooses…" where the deciding player is whoever controls the gathered cards and may be you or an
    opponent (Barrin's Spite: gather the two targeted creatures, their controller sacrifices one, the other is returned
    to hand). Use `ControllerOfTarget` for "destroy target permanent. Its controller searches/chooses…" where the
    targeted permanent's controller performs a follow-up (Magmatic Hellkite: destroy target nonbasic land, *its
    controller* searches for a basic). The same `chooser` set is accepted by `ChoosePileEffect`.

**Linked exile**

- `Effects.ExileGroupAndLink(filter, storeAs?)` — exile matching permanents linked to source.
- `Effects.ReturnLinkedExile` — return all to controller.
- `ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl` — return to owners.
- `ReturnLinkedExileToHand` — return to hand.
- `ReturnOneFromLinkedExile` — return one chosen card.
- `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()` — play permission targeting linked-exile pile.
- `CardSource.FromExile(name)` — play permission for a named exile zone.

**Face-down**

- `PutOntoBattlefieldFaceDown(count, target?)` — enter face-down (morph shape).
- `Triggers.TurnedFaceUp` — fires when source flips face-up.
- UI label: `"Turn Face-Up"` (used by E2E `selectAction("Turn Face-Up")`).

---

## 18. Components (set indirectly by effects)

### Permanent

- `ChosenModeComponent` — chosen entry mode (Sieges, modal permanents).
- `TypeLineOverrideComponent` — temporary type-line edits.
- `CountersComponent` — all counters on the permanent.
- `EnchantedCreatureComponent` — reference to attached creature (Auras).
- `EquippedCreatureComponent` — reference to equipped creature.
- `LinkedExileComponent` — linked exile pile attached to source.
- `ExileOnLeaveComponent` — replace next zone change with exile.
- `MayPlayFromExileComponent` — owner may play this from exile.
- `TappedStateComponent` — tap state.
- `FaceDownComponent` — face-down state.
- `ControllerComponent` — current controller.
- `ProtectionComponent` — protection from colors/types.
- `CantAttackComponent` / `CantBlockComponent` — combat restrictions.

### Player

- `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent` — you have City's Blessing.
- `TheRingComponent` — you have the Ring emblem; `temptCount` gates its four abilities (CR 701.54).
- `RingBearerComponent` — designates a creature as a player's Ring-bearer (on the creature, not the player).
- `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent` — your matching spells can't be countered.
- `LifeGainedAmountThisTurnComponent` — accumulator for life gained.
- `LifeLostThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've lost life this turn.
- `PlayerAttackedThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've attacked this turn.
- `PlayerAttackersThisTurnComponent` — list of attackers declared this turn.
- `PlayerAttackedPlayersThisTurnComponent` — set of defending players you "attacked" this turn (CR
  508.6); read by `PlayerAttackedPlayerThisTurn`.
- `LandDropsComponent` — lands played this turn.
- `FoodSacrificeThisTurnComponent` — marker that you sacrificed a Food this turn.
- `SpellsCastThisTurnByPlayer` — count of spells you cast this turn.

Card authors rarely reference these directly; they are created/updated by the matching effect or trigger.

---

## 19. Named-mechanic composites

- **Cycling / Typecycling / Basic landcycling** — `KeywordAbility.Cycling(cost)`, `Typecycling(type, cost)`,
  `BasicLandcycling(cost)`; unified via `TypecyclingVariant(cost, searchFilter, description)` in `TypecycleCardHandler`.
- **Plot (CR 718)** — `KeywordAbility.plot(cost)`. Engine wires a sorcery-speed `PlotEnumerator` + `PlotCardHandler`
  that pays the plot cost, exiles the card face-up from hand, stamps `PlottedComponent(controllerId, turnPlotted)` +
  `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent`, and adds a permanent `MayPlayPermission` gated by `SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`.
  The cast-from-exile path is the standard `MayPlayPermission` flow in `CastFromZoneEnumerator` — `permanent = true`
  keeps the grant alive across end-of-turn cleanup. Emits `CardPlottedEvent` / `ClientEvent.CardPlotted`.
- **Adventure (CR 715)** — `layout = ADVENTURE` + `cardFaces[0]` Adventure spell; DSL:
  `card { adventure("Name") { spell { … } } }`.
- **Omen (Tarkir: Dragonstorm)** — `layout = OMEN` + `cardFaces[0]` Omen spell; DSL:
  `card { omen("Name") { spell { … } } }`. Reuses the Adventure cast/enumeration path (`enumerateSecondaryFace`,
  cast via `CastSpell.faceIndex = 0`), but `StackResolver` routes the resolving Omen to `Zone.LIBRARY` and shuffles
  the owner's library (`shuffleOwnerLibrary` + `LibraryShuffledEvent`) instead of exiling with a `MayPlayPermission`.
  No new effect/component — the layout enum drives the resolution fork. First user: Dirgur Island Dragon //
  Skimming Strike.
- **Modal DFC (CR 712)** — `layout = MODAL_DFC` + `cardFaces[0]` back face; DSL:
  `card { modalBack("Name") { imageUri = …; spell { selfExile(); … } } }`. Cast either face from hand (back via
  `CastSpell.faceIndex = 0`); reuses the Adventure cast/enumeration path (`enumerateSecondaryFace`) but with no
  exile-then-recast linkage at resolution. `StackResolver` reads the cast face's `selfExileOnResolve`, and the back
  art rides on `CardFace.imageUri` → `CardComponent.backFaceImageUri`. First user: Flamescroll Celebrant.
- **Prepare / Prepared (Secrets of Strixhaven)** — `layout = PREPARE` + `cardFaces[0]` prepare spell; DSL:
  `card { prepare("Name") { spell { … } } }`. The creature is only cast as itself. A creature that carries
  `Keyword.PREPARED` ("This creature enters prepared") becomes prepared on enter
  (`StackResolver.enterPermanentOnBattlefield`, gated on the keyword). A PREPARE-layout creature *without* the
  keyword (Leech Collector, Joined Researchers) only becomes prepared via `Effects.BecomePrepared(target)`
  (`BecomePreparedExecutor`). Both paths call the shared `PreparationLogic.makePrepared`, which
  creates a stack-style copy of the prepare spell in the controller's exile carrying
  `PreparedSpellCopyComponent(sourceId)`, stamps `PreparedComponent(exileCopyId)` on the creature, and grants a
  permanent `MayPlayPermission` for the copy. `CastFromZoneEnumerator` recognizes the copy and offers it as
  `CastSpell(..., faceIndex = 0)` from `EXILE` using the prepare face's cost/targets. Casting the copy
  (`StackResolver.castSpell`) strips the source's `PreparedComponent` and consumes the permission; the copy resolves
  via the face script and ceases to exist (`CopyOfComponent`). The exiled copy is exempt from the 707.10a
  phantom-copy SBA (`PhantomCardCopiesCheck`) while linked, and that same check removes it once the source leaves
  the battlefield or stops being prepared. First users: Adventurous Eater // Have a Bite, Landscape Painter //
  Vibrant Idea; becomes-prepared-via-trigger: Leech Collector // Bloodletting, Joined Researchers // Secret
  Rendezvous (end-step trigger gated on `Conditions.OpponentHasMoreCardsInHand`).
- **Hideaway N** — `KeywordAbility.hideaway(n)` (display, "Hideaway N") + `MoveCollectionEffect(faceDown = FaceDownMode.HIDDEN,
  linkToSource = true)` + `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()`; no special engine plumbing needed.
- **Ascend / City's Blessing** — `Keyword.ASCEND` + `Effects.GainCitysBlessing()` + `Conditions.YouHaveCitysBlessing` /
  `SourceProjectionCondition.ControllerHasCitysBlessing` + `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent`.
- **Siege (named-mode entry)** — `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.MODE, modeOptions = ...)` + `SourceChosenModeIs("id")`.
- **Morph** — `morph = "{2}{U}"` (top-level) + `morphFaceUpEffect` for "as it turns face up".
- **Warp** — `warp = "{1}{R}"`; alt-cost that exiles end of turn.
- **Evoke** — `evoke = "{U}"`; pay alt cost, sacrifice on ETB.
- **Sneak** — `sneak("{1}{U}")`; declare-blockers-step alt cost (pay mana + return an unblocked attacker you control to hand); a resolving permanent enters tapped and attacking the same defender. `Conditions.SneakCostWasPaid` reads the rider flag.
- **Earthbend** — `Effects.Earthbend` composes AnimateLand + GrantKeyword + AddCounters + granted self-triggers (no fake
  keyword).
- **Endure N** — `Effects.Endure(amount, target = EffectTarget.Self)` composes a `ModalEffect.chooseOne` of
  AddDynamicCounters (N +1/+1 counters on the enduring permanent) and a single N/N white Spirit `CreateTokenEffect`
  (no fake keyword — endure is always the effect of a triggered/activated ability, resolved at resolution time). `amount`
  is `DynamicAmount.Fixed` for "endure 2" or any dynamic value for "endure X" (e.g. Warden of the Grove reads
  `EntityProperty(Source, CounterCount(...))`); `target` defaults to `Self` ("it endures") but takes
  `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` when a card endures the creature that triggered it.
- **Forage** — `Patterns.Mechanic.forage`; cast-from-graveyard permissions need a branch in `CastSpellHandler.validate`.
- **Blight X** — `Costs.additional.BlightVariable` + `DynamicAmount.AdditionalCostBlightAmount` +
  `Conditions.BlightWasPaid(n)`.
- **Divvy (Fact-or-Fiction)** — `Patterns.Library.factOrFiction(...)`; `SplitPilesDecision` stays dormant until N > 2.
- **Astral Slide / delayed return** — `ExileUntilEndStepEffect` + `DelayedTriggeredAbility`.
- **Lord effects** — multiple `staticAbility { }` blocks + `ModifyStatsForCreatureGroup` /
  `AffectsFilter.OtherCreaturesWithSubtype`.
- **Player-scoped uncounterable grant** — `Effects.GrantSpellsCantBeCountered(target, filter, duration)` +
  `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent`.
- **Static emblems** — `Effects.CreatePermanentEmblem(...)` for planeswalker emblems with static abilities.
- **The Ring / the Ring tempts you (CR 701.54)** — `Effects.TheRingTemptsYou(target = Controller)`: the player gets
  the Ring emblem (`TheRingComponent`, tempt-count tracked) and chooses a creature they control to become their
  Ring-bearer (`RingBearerComponent` designation). The emblem's four cumulative abilities are resolved by the engine,
  not card data: the bearer is made legendary in `StateProjector` and can't be blocked by greater power via
  `RingBearerCantBeBlockedByGreaterPowerRule`; the ≥2/≥3/≥4 triggered abilities are appended to the bearer by
  `TriggerAbilityResolver` (see `TheRingAbilities`). For card triggers/checks use `Triggers.RingTemptsYou`
  ("Whenever the Ring tempts you"), `Conditions.SourceIsRingBearer` ("if this is your Ring-bearer"), and
  `Conditions.YouChoseOtherCreatureAsRingBearer` ("if you chose a creature other than this as your
  Ring-bearer" — pairs with `Triggers.RingTemptsYou` for the Aragorn/Faramir/Gandalf/Galadriel cycle).
  CR 701.54a: the designation ends permanently when another player gains control of the bearer —
  every control-change executor strips `RingBearerComponent` via `clearRingBearerOnControlChange`, so a
  temporary steal (Threaten) does not silently restore the designation when control reverts.
- **Amass [subtype] N (CR 701.47)** — `Effects.Amass(count, subtype)` (fixed) or
  `Effects.Amass(amount, subtype)` (a `DynamicAmount`, for "amass Orcs X"). `subtype` is required (no default) —
  the amassed Army's type is printed on each card (Orcs for the LTR cards). If the controller controls no Army
  creature, a 0/0 black `[subtype]` Army token is created first (composing `CreateTokenEffect`); then they put N
  +1/+1 counters on an Army they control (a `SelectCardsDecision` resolved by `AmassContinuation` picks which one
  when they control several) and that Army becomes the subtype if it isn't already. The counter/subtype back half
  lives in `AmassResolution`; counters route through `AddCountersEffect`, so placement replacements still apply.

## 20. Miscellaneous author-facing knobs

- `triggeredAbility { controlledByTriggeringEntityController = true }` — the triggered ability is controlled by the
  triggering entity's controller (not source's). Useful for ETB-on-creature triggers and Death Match-style shapes.
- `metadata.oracleTextOverride` — bypass auto-generated oracle text when needed.
- `metadata.inBooster = false` — Special Guests, starter exclusives, bonus sheets.
- `colorIdentity` override is authoritative — never run `:mtg-sets:syncColorIdentityFromDump`.
- Layer dependencies (CR 613.8) — same-layer effects sort by dependency (trial application) before falling back to
  timestamp.
- Server is authoritative; never compute legal actions in the client. Every state change emits a `GameEvent` so triggers
  and animations can react.

### Ability identity (engine-internal, not authored)

`AbilityIdentity(cardDefinitionId, abilityId)` (`mtg-sdk` `scripting/AbilityIdentity.kt`) is the stable, **definition-scoped**
identity of a *kind* of ability — independent of the stack object or source entity instance. Two permanents printed from the
same card (and every future instance) share one identity for a given ability, because both halves are definition-scoped:
`cardDefinitionId` is the source's `CardComponent.cardDefinitionId`, and `abilityId` is the ability's `AbilityId` (generated
once when the card definition is built). Cards never author it: the engine threads it onto `TriggeredAbilityOnStackComponent`
/ `ActivatedAbilityOnStackComponent` (via `GameState.abilityIdentityOf(sourceId, abilityId)`) and onto `DecisionContext`, so
batch decisions can group structurally identical triggers and persistent yields can remember a per-ability answer across all
copies. Null for synthesized sources with no card definition (e.g. spell copies). See
`backlog/stack-collapse-and-batch-decisions.md` §C.2.

### Batched may-question (engine-internal, not authored)

When a run of structurally identical **optional, targeted** triggers ("Whenever …, you may … *target* …") fires off one
event, the engine asks the controller a single `BatchYesNoDecision` instead of one `YesNoDecision` per trigger — Magic
Online's "auto-stack identical triggers" affordance (`backlog/stack-collapse-and-batch-decisions.md` §B). Cards author
nothing: `TriggerProcessor` groups contiguous `liveTriggers` sharing one (controller, `AbilityIdentity`) key (and that would
actually raise the may-question rather than fizzle for lack of targets) into one decision carrying a `count`. The reply,
`BatchYesNoResponse(choice, applyToAll)`, is fanned back out by `BatchMayTriggerContinuation`:

- `applyToAll = true` resolves the whole run (`no` drops it; `yes` unwraps each may-gate and routes every instance through
  ordinary per-trigger target selection — only the yes/no is shared, never the target).
- `applyToAll = false` peels one instance off (answered with `choice`) and re-raises the batch for the remainder.

Only same-controller, same-identity, targeted-may triggers batch; targetless "may" triggers still decide at resolution, and a
lone trigger uses the plain per-trigger yes/no. The guard guarantees the engine never makes a meaningful target/ordering
choice on the player's behalf.

## 21. Structural lint (`CardLinter`)

Every registered card is structurally validated at build time: `CardValidator.validate` runs
`CardLinter` (mtg-sdk `serialization/CardLinter.kt`), and the corpus-wide gate is
`CardLintTest` in mtg-sets (beside `CardDefinitionSnapshotTest`). The linter walks the card's
serialized JSON tree, so every container — composites, gates, modes, granted abilities, class
levels, saga chapters, faces — is covered automatically. What it checks:

- **Pipeline dataflow** — every read of a named pipeline variable (`MoveCollection.from`,
  `CardSource.FromVariable`, `VariableReference`, `CollectionContainsMatch`, `chosenSubtypeKey`,
  …) must have a writer (`storeAs` / `storeSelected` / `storeMatching` / `StoreNumber` /
  `ChooseOption` / a cast-time additional cost, …) in the same resolution scope. A read written
  *nowhere* on the card is an **error** (typo → silent no-op); read-before-write and
  cross-resolution reads are warnings, as are stores nothing reads. A collection write `x`
  also satisfies the numeric read `x_count`.
- **Target bindings per owning ability** — `ContextTarget(i)` must fit the owning ability's
  flattened target slots (a `count = 2` requirement spans two indices); `BoundVariable(name)`
  must match a requirement `id` (indexed form `id[i]` allowed). Modes inherit the card-level
  requirements unless they declare their own; `ReflexiveTriggerEffect.reflexiveEffect` resolves
  against `reflexiveTargetRequirements`; `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.effect` against its
  `targetRequirement`; granted/token abilities against their own requirements only.
- **Choice slots** — a `ChoiceSlot` read (`CastChoiceMade`, `DynamicAmount.CastChoice`,
  `HasChosenColor`, `SourceChosenModeIs`, …) needs a declarer on the card (`EntersWithChoice`,
  kicker, blight, sneak, `ChooseColorThen`/`ChooseColorForTarget`); `SourceChosenModeIs` ids
  must match a declared `modeOptions` id.
- **Registry hygiene** — a string field whose name follows the dataflow conventions (`store*`,
  `from`, `collectionName`, `variableName`, …) on a node type the linter doesn't know is itself
  an error: **when you add an SDK type that reads or writes a named pipeline variable, classify
  it in `CardLinter.dataflowFields` in the same change** (and name the field conventionally so
  the hygiene net sees it).
- **`EntityMatches` entity roles** — the condition's `entity` must be a role the
  `ConditionEvaluator` dispatches (`Self`, `EnchantedPermanent`, `EnchantedCreature`,
  `EquippedCreature`, `ContextTarget`, `TriggeringEntity`); any other `EffectTarget` would be a
  silent constant `false` and is an **error**. Extending the evaluator to a new role must extend
  `CardLinter.supportedEntityMatchesRoles` in the same change.

Intentional exceptions go in `mtg-sets/src/test/resources/lint-allowlist.txt`
(`ErrorType|Card Name`, stale entries fail). Inside `ForEachInGroup` / `ForEachInCollection`,
address the iterated entity with `EffectTarget.Self` — `ContextTarget(0)` reads the cast-time
target list, which is unrelated to the iteration (this exact bug shipped on a real card before
the linter).
