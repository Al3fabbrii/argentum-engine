/**
 * Scenario tests for Sonic Shrieker (#226) and its new [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.conditions.TargetIsPlayer]
 * condition.
 *
 * ETB: "deals 2 damage to any target and you gain 2 life. If a player is dealt damage this way,
 * they discard a card." The discard rider is gated on the damaged "any target" having been a
 * player and aimed back at that same player via ContextTarget.
