/**
 * 704.5m - An Aura attached to an illegal object/player or not attached goes to graveyard.
 * 704.5n - An Equipment or Fortification attached to an illegal permanent becomes unattached
 *          but remains on the battlefield. This drives two Equipment cases below, both asked
 *          of the projected state (so layer-4 type-changing effects are seen):
 *            - The host stops being a creature (an Equipment can only equip a creature, CR
 *              301.5). E.g. the equipped creature is turned into a land, or an animated
 *              artifact's "until end of turn" animation wears off while still equipped.
 *            - The Equipment itself becomes a creature, so it can't legally equip another
 *              creature unless it has reconfigure (CR 301.5c). E.g. Atomic Microsizer turned
 *              into a 0/0 Robot artifact creature by Tezzeret, Cruel Captain's emblem.
 * 704.5p - A battle or creature attached to an object or player becomes unattached but
 *          remains on the battlefield.
 *
 * Protection (CR 702.16c/d): a permanent with protection from a quality can't be enchanted by
 * Auras (put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action) or equipped by Equipment
 * (becomes unattached, stays on the battlefield) that have the stated quality. This covers
 * protection gained *after* the attachment landed — targeting-time protection is enforced by
 * `TargetValidator`. An attachment whose own printed ability grants that very protection to
 * its host is exempt ("This effect doesn't remove this Aura", the Ward cycle).
