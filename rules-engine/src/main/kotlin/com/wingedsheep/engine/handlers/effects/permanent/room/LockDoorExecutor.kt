/**
 * Executor for [LockDoorEffect] — the resolution-time "lock a door" instruction (CR 709.5g), the
 * twin of [UnlockDoorExecutor].
 *
 * Delegates to the shared [RoomDoorResolution], which locks one of the targeted Room's unlocked
 * doors via [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.room.RoomDoorLocker] — turning that half's
 * text off and emitting a `DoorLockedEvent`. When the Room has more than one unlocked door the
 * resolver pauses for the controller to choose which one to lock (CR 709.5g); a Room with no
 * unlocked door resolves as a harmless no-op. Locking fires no triggers and never fully unlocks a
 * Room (see [LockDoorEffect]).
