/**
 * Executor for [UnlockDoorEffect] — the resolution-time "unlock a door" instruction (CR 709.5f).
 *
 * Delegates to the shared [RoomDoorResolution], which unlocks one of the targeted Room's locked
 * doors via [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.room.RoomDoorUnlocker] — emitting the same
 * `DoorUnlockedEvent` / `RoomFullyUnlockedEvent` the unlock-cost special action emits, so "When you
 * unlock this door" triggers (CR 709.5h) fire normally off the returned events.
 *
 * The target is "up to one" (optional): a fully-unlocked Room is never offered as a target (the
 * `hasLockedDoor()` targeting restriction), and choosing no target resolves as a harmless no-op.
 * When the Room has more than one locked door (it entered without being cast, CR 709.5d), the
 * resolver pauses for the controller to choose which door to unlock (CR 709.5f).
