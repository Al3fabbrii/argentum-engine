/**
 * Tests for Earth Kingdom General's second ability:
 * "Whenever you put one or more +1/+1 counters on a creature, you may gain that much life.
 *  Do this only once each turn."
 *
 * The oracle recipient is "a creature" (ANY creature, not just yours), so the "you put" scope
 * is carried by the trigger's `placedBy = Player.You` selector (CR 122.6a) rather than a
 * "creature you control" recipient filter. These tests pin the placer distinction — a placement
 * by *you* fires it, a placement by an *opponent* does not — plus the CR 122.6 enters-with-counters
 * case and the once-per-turn gate.
