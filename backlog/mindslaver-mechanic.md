# Mindslaver mechanic — "you control target opponent during their next turn"

Driving card: **The Dominion Bracelet** (Edge of Eternities). The first card to require this primitive; future cards (Mindslaver, Sorin Markov, etc.) will reuse it. The work is split into a card shell (PR 1, shipped) and three engine/UX phases (PR 2A done, 2B/2C pending).

## Current status

| Phase | Status | Commit |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **PR 1 — card shell, no-op hijack** | ✅ shipped | `0a80ba9b5` |
| **2A — engine lifecycle** | ✅ shipped | `874fc1575` |
| **2B — input routing** | ✅ shipped | (this commit) |
| **2C — frontend visibility / UX** | ⏳ pending | — |
| **PR 2D — proper card sourcing + cost reduction** | ⏳ pending | — |

## What works today

- Card is registered, castable, equippable. The granted activated ability is on the Bracelet itself (PR 1 placeholder) with cost `Composite(Mana({15}), ExileSelf)`, sorcery-speed, target-opponent.
- `HijackNextTurnEffect` resolves and attaches `PlayerTurnHijackedComponent(controllerId, SCHEDULED)` to the targeted player, latest-wins.
- `TurnManager.startTurn` transitions the component to `ACTIVE` when that player's actual next turn begins. Skipped turns wait per the Scryfall ruling.
- `CleanupPhaseManager.cleanupEndOfTurn` removes the component when the controlled turn ends.
- `GameState.actorFor(playerId)` is the public helper: returns the controller during ACTIVE, the player otherwise.

Tests: `rules-engine/src/test/kotlin/com/wingedsheep/engine/scenarios/PlayerTurnHijackedComponentTest.kt` covers SCHEDULED→ACTIVE, ACTIVE→removed, skip-turn waiting, and the helper.

**The mechanic does not yet route input.** The component flips state but `priorityPlayerId` and `pendingDecision.playerId` still point at the affected player — clicking has no effect because the controller can't submit on their behalf.

## Phase 2B — input routing (next)

### Convention

Per CR 722 / Mindslaver rulings, the **affected player V is the spell controller** — V's mana pays, V's cards are cast, V is the "actor" in game-rules terms. The controlling player H is only the *input device* that selects which decision V makes. With that as the model:

- `action.playerId` is **always the affected player V**, in normal play and during hijack.
- The controller's client sends actions tagged with V's playerId (it knows V via `youAreHijacking`).
- The seat check (which WebSocket may submit an action for V) lives at the server — the engine doesn't need to learn about hijack.

### Engine
- `SubmitDecisionHandler.validate` keeps the strict `pending.playerId == action.playerId` check. No change needed; `action.playerId` is V on both ends.
- Per-action handlers (`CastSpellHandler`, `ActivateAbilityHandler`, `PlayLandHandler`, combat handlers, `PassPriorityHandler`) — no changes. Their `state.priorityPlayerId == action.playerId` / `activePlayerId == action.playerId` checks compare V to V and remain correct.
- `ManaSolver` / `CostHandler` etc. continue to read costs against `action.playerId` (== V). This was already correct.

### Game-server
- `GameSession.executeAction(seatId, action)`: validate `seatId == action.playerId || state.actorFor(action.playerId) == seatId`. Reject otherwise. The seat is the WebSocket session's player.
- `GameSession.getLegalActions(seatId)`: return enumerated actions when `seatId == state.actorFor(state.priorityPlayerId)` — same legal-actions list whether the affected player or the controller is asking.
- `GameSession.createStateUpdate(seatId)`: route `pendingDecision` to the actor (controller) when hijacked — the affected-player branch (`pending.playerId == playerId`) becomes `state.actorFor(pending.playerId) == playerId`.
- AI: `GamePlayHandler` lookups against `aiPlayer.playerId` for `getLegalActions` keep working, since `actorFor(V) == V` when not hijacked.

### Client DTO
- New optional fields on `ClientGameState`:
  - `youAreHijacking: EntityId?` — the affected player you're currently controlling, if any.
  - `youAreHijackedBy: EntityId?` — the controller currently driving your turn, if any.
- Populate from `state.actorFor` in `ClientStateTransformer.transform`.

### Tests for 2B
- Scenario: while V's turn is hijacked, `getLegalActions(V)` and `getLegalActions(H)` both return V's legal actions.
- Scenario: `executeAction(H, action-tagged-V)` succeeds; `executeAction(V, action-tagged-V)` also succeeds; an unrelated seat is rejected.
- Scenario: controller H casts a spell from V's hand — the spell on the stack has `controllerId == V`, mana is deducted from V's pool, card moves from V's hand → V's stack/battlefield zone.

## Phase 2C — frontend visibility / UX

Designs landed: see conversation transcript on commit `874fc1575`. Summary:

- **Banner.** Top-bar pill, two states:
  - "You are controlling Vincent's turn — using only their resources" (controller's view).
  - "Your opponent is controlling your turn." (affected player's view, click handlers disabled, concede stays live).
- **Hand interactivity.** Promote the opponent's hand at the top from card-backs to a real `Hand` component when `youAreHijacking != null`. Reuses `GameCard` and `Hand`; reads V's hand data from `cards` in the client state. Opponent's view stays normal (face-up to themselves).
- **Tints / pills.** Purple frame on V's hand and V's battlefield row when controlled. Small `🔒 Vincent's hand (you control)` pill at the corner of the top hand and `Your hand` on the bottom.
- **Active surface cue.** Whichever hand currently has live legal actions gets the green "playable" highlight; the dimmed one indicates you can see but can't act yet.
- **Visibility.** `ClientStateTransformer.isZoneVisibleTo` (currently line ~316) — extend the `Zone.HAND` branch:
  ```kotlin
  Zone.HAND -> debugMode || zoneKey.ownerId == viewingPlayerId ||
      state.actorFor(zoneKey.ownerId) == viewingPlayerId
  ```
  Crucial constraint: do *not* leak hidden info that V themselves can't see (e.g. V's opponent's hand). The rule is "controller sees what V sees," not "all hidden zones."
- **Spectator masking.** Sanity-check `SpectatorStateBuilder` so spectators don't gain access to the hijacked hand.

### Tests for 2C
- Playwright: full flow — equip Bracelet, activate, opponent's hand becomes face-up next turn, controller casts a spell from it, opponent sees disabled UI + banner.

## Phase 2D — faithful card sourcing + cost reduction

PR 1 took two deliberate shortcuts that should be cleaned up once 2A–2C land. Without these, the card is technically playable but cost is unreduced.

### SDK
- New cost type `AbilityCost.ExileGrantingPermanent` — exiles the entity that granted this activated ability to the source. Resolved at activation time by walking `GrantActivatedAbilityToAttachedCreature` like `getStaticGrantedActivatedAbilities` already does.
- New field on `ActivatedAbility`:
  ```kotlin
  val genericCostReduction: DynamicAmount? = null
  ```
  Evaluated against the source entity at activation time, reducing the generic mana portion via `ManaCost.reduceGeneric(amount)`.

### Engine
- `ActivateAbilityHandler` (around line 160): after computing `effectiveCost`, evaluate `genericCostReduction` against the source and apply via `reduceGeneric`. Lock the reduced cost in (per Scryfall ruling, "cost is locked in before costs are paid").
- Granter tracking: `getStaticGrantedActivatedAbilities` currently returns a list of `ActivatedAbility` with no granter ID; thread the granter through (e.g. `Pair<ActivatedAbility, EntityId>`) so the executor for `ExileGrantingPermanent` can find the equipment to exile. Same change in `CastPermissionUtils.getStaticGrantedActivatedAbilities`.

### Card update
Switch the activated ability from being on the Bracelet to being granted to the equipped creature:
```kotlin
staticAbility {
    ability = GrantActivatedAbilityToAttachedCreature(
        ability = ActivatedAbility(
            cost = AbilityCost.Composite(
                AbilityCost.Mana(ManaCost.parse("{15}")),
                AbilityCost.ExileGrantingPermanent
            ),
            genericCostReduction = DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(
                EntityReference.Source, EntityNumericProperty.Power
            ),
            timing = TimingRule.SorcerySpeed,
            effect = Effects.HijackNextTurn(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0)),
            targetRequirements = listOf(TargetOpponent())
        )
    )
}
```
Drop the placeholder activated-ability block on the Bracelet itself.

## Risks & open questions

- **AI advisors.** Combat advisors and the MCTS side will need `actorFor` awareness if the engine ever offers AI players. Currently low-pri — neither the AI nor the trainer cares about input authority, only state evolution.
- **Multiplayer.** Engine assumes 2-player. `actorFor` works for any seat count; "target opponent" → "the only opponent" simplification needs revisiting if/when multiplayer lands.
- **Concession.** Per ruling, V can still concede during the controlled turn. Verify `Concede` handler routes by `action.playerId` and ignores `actorFor` — concession is a player-level escape hatch, not a normal in-game action.
- **Triggered abilities.** The controller's own permanents may have triggers during V's turn. Those triggers' decisions belong to *them*, not V. Should fall out automatically since `ability.controllerId` is the controller, not V — but worth a focused test.
