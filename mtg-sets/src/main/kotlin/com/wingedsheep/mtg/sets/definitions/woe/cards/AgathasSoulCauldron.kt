/**
 * Agatha's Soul Cauldron
 * {2}
 * Legendary Artifact (Wilds of Eldraine, mythic)
 *
 * "You may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to activate abilities of creatures
 *  you control.
 *  Creatures you control with +1/+1 counters on them have all activated abilities of all creature
 *  cards exiled with Agatha's Soul Cauldron.
 *  {T}: Exile target card from a graveyard. When a creature card is exiled this way, put a +1/+1
 *  counter on target creature you control."
 *
 * Implementation — three reusable static/activated pieces:
 *  - [SpendAnyManaTypeForActivatedAbilities] scoped to `AllCreaturesYouControl`: relaxes the
 *    colored/colorless requirements of the mana cost of any ability activated from a creature you
 *    control (CR 609.4b), so the granted (and printed) abilities of your creatures can be paid with
 *    mana of any type. Same engine seam as Sharkey, Tyrant of the Shire (there scoped to Self).
 *  - [HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfLinkedExiledCard] with a battlefield filter ("creatures you control
 *    with a +1/+1 counter") and `creatureCardsOnly = true`: every creature card in the Cauldron's
 *    linked-exile pile lends its activated abilities to each such creature, with that creature as
 *    the abilities' source (so `{T}` taps it and self-references bind to it — the printed ruling).
 *  - The `{T}` activated ability exiles a targeted graveyard card linked to the Cauldron, then —
 *    only if that card was a creature card (a reflexive trigger, resolved inline via
 *    [ConditionalEffect]) — chooses a creature you control and puts a +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * Rulings (2023-09-01):
 *  - Grants only *activated* abilities, never keyword (unless activated), triggered, or static ones.
 *  - The granted abilities use "this permanent," so they're treated as printed on the creature that
 *    gained them.
