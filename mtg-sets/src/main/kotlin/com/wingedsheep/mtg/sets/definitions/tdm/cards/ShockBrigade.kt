 * Menace
 * Mobilize 1 (Whenever this creature attacks, create a tapped and attacking 1/1 red Warrior
 * creature token. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.)
 *
 * Both abilities are keyword helpers: `keywords(Keyword.MENACE)` for the evasion keyword and
 * the `mobilize(n)` builder helper, which adds the display-only "Mobilize 1" keyword ability
 * plus the attack-triggered ability that creates the tapped-and-attacking Warrior token and
 * schedules its sacrifice at the next end step.
