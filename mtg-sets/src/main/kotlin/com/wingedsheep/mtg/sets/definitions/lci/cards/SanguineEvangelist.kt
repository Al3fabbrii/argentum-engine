/**
 * Sanguine Evangelist
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Vampire Cleric
 * 2/1
 *
 * Battle cry (Whenever this creature attacks, each other attacking creature gets +1/+0 until
 * end of turn.)
 * When this creature enters or dies, create a 1/1 black Bat creature token with flying.
 *
 * Battle cry is not a distinct engine keyword; it is modeled from its reminder text as a
 * `Triggers.Attacks` (SELF) ability that pumps every OTHER attacking creature. The mass buff
 * uses `ForEachInGroup` over the group of attacking creatures (excluding this one) so each
 * attacker receives its own +1/+0 floating effect — a `GroupRef` target on `ModifyStats` is
 * not expanded per-permanent (The Wind Crystal idiom). The filter is unrestricted by
 * controller ("each other attacking creature", CR 702.91a).
 *
 * "Enters or dies" is two triggered abilities (enters + dies) sharing one effect, mirroring
 * Queen's Bay Paladin's enters/attacks split. The 1/1 black flying Bat reuses the Bloomburrow
 * Bat token art (no distinct Lost Caverns of Ixalan Bat token is modeled in the repo).
